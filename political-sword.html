    <div class="entry"><div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“Julia
 Gillard is not getting her message out”. “She is not cutting through”. 
“People have stopped listening”. “Her message is being drowned out by 
noise”. How many times have we heard that? But how many have pointed out
 that it is the media that creates most of the distracting noise?  How 
many times have we seen any thoughtful analysis in the media of why this
 is so? Pitifully few. This piece attempts to fill that yawning gap. <br><br>
 There have been many studies of communication.  I won’t attempt to make
 this a learned treatise but rather will draw on my experience over the 
years and my more recent observations of politics. <br><br> A simple 
model of communication includes the transmitter, the message, the medium
 and the receiver, which I shall dissect.  It’s much more complicated 
than that, but let’s start with the basic structure, and apply it to PM 
Gillard and her Government and Tony Abbott and his Opposition. <br><br> <strong>The transmitter</strong><br>
 The personality and style of the messenger is crucial to getting the 
message across.  We all know how dull and boring speakers put off their 
audiences.  The media accuse Julia Gillard of having a drawl, an ocker 
accent, and slow speech.  Add to that what they often spotlight: 
inappropriate dress, big earlobes, unusual earrings, red hair, a pointy 
nose and an ample backside, and any hope that the message she is hoping 
to transmit might get a guernsey is remote.  Distracted by the 
inconsequential and governed by the media’s <em>modus operandi</em>, the media fails to hear what she is saying, often deliberately, and thereby fails to transmit it. <br><br>
 She certainly does not have the oratory of a Bill Clinton or a Tony 
Blair, the dulcet tones of Malcolm Turnbull, the lofty words of Gough 
Whitlam, the acerbic language of Paul Keating, or the scalawag charm of 
Bob Hawke.  She is a Welsh immigrant brought up in South Australia, 
educated at Unley High School and the University of Melbourne, no doubt 
attaining her accent and speech from those environments.  She seems to 
be sincere and genuine, although her adversaries would dispute that.  So
 we, and the media, all have a choice: focus on her speaking attributes 
which we may or may not like, or listen to her message.  So far the 
media has too often chosen the former.  The latter might be more 
edifying for us all. <br><br> It certainly helps if the orator has a 
pleasant mode of delivery, or at least one that does not detract from 
the message.  So if we don’t like PM Gillard’s delivery, we can ignore 
it and listen for the message, or ignore her, which is what much of the 
media and possibly the public are doing. <br><br> Although it seems to 
attract little attention from the media, Tony Abbott’s mode of delivery 
is no paragon.  His raspy voice is unattractive, his forced laugh at 
times bordering on maniacal, his hesitancy off-putting, his but, but, 
but irritating, his deviousness and slyness unnerving, and his 
occasional muteness astonishing.  But never mind, that’s just Tony! <br><br> <strong>The receiver</strong><br>
 The receiver needs to be considered alongside the transmitter as the 
latter needs to be geared to the former.  There are three common modes 
of language that people prefer for receiving information: visual, 
auditory and kinesthetic (or feeling).  Those with a preference for 
visual language respond well to: ‘I see what you mean’; those who prefer
 auditory to: “I hear what you are saying; and those who like 
kinesthetic language to: ‘I know how you feel’.  People accept messages 
more readily via their preferred mode, so the transmitter will achieve 
better results using that mode.  It is easy to determine the preferred 
mode in one-to-one conversations and use it, as those familiar with 
neurolinguistic programming know, but that is not possible in large 
audiences. <br><br> A public speaker encounters all three preferences, 
but as visual is preferred by more than the others, that ought to be the
 mode generally used by the transmitter.  However, there are occasions 
where the other modes are more appropriate; for example in the face of a
 natural disaster, or a tragedy, kinesthetic language: ‘I feel for you 
in your tragic situation’, is more suitable. <br><br> A good public 
speaker will mix these modes and use phrases like: “We can see what 
needs to be done and will find our way through the problem’ and ‘We are 
listening to what you are telling us, and will respond to your message’,
 and “We feel your pain, we grasp what is needed, and will carry it 
through’.   Reflect on Julia Gillard’s language.  How often have you 
heard her using kinesthetic (feeling) words: ‘I feel/understand your 
pain’; ‘I know you are doing it tough’? <br><br> Tony Abbott uses a lot 
of kinesthetic language, as so often his objective is to have his 
audience feel the pain of rising costs, of ‘toxic’ taxes, of job losses,
 of businesses closing, of ‘ghost towns’.  Sometimes he uses the 
auditory, usually urging the PM to ‘listen’ to the people.  Since he is 
not heavily into a vision for our nation, visual language does not 
feature much in his utterances, except of course when he uses the spacer
 word ‘look’ over and again in tight interviews. <br><br> A good speaker
 will also personalize messages by the use of words such as ‘you’ and 
‘yours’, reaching out to the individual elector. <br><br> <strong>The medium</strong><br>
 No discussion of the medium should fail to mention the author of the 
aphorism: “The medium is the message”, Marshall McLuhan. According to <em>Wikipedia:</em> <em>“Marshall
 McLuhan was a Canadian educator, philosopher, and scholar – a professor
 of English literature, a literary critic, a rhetorician, and a 
communication theorist. McLuhan's work is viewed as one of the 
cornerstones of the study of media theory, as well as having practical 
applications in the advertising and television industries.”</em> His 1964 book, <em>Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man</em> was seminal and echoes still in the corridors of media studies. <br><br> <em>“McLuhan
 understood "medium" in a broad sense. He identified the light bulb as a
 clear demonstration of the concept of “the medium is the message”. A 
light bulb does not have content in the way that a newspaper has 
articles or a television has programs, yet it is a medium that has a 
social effect; that is, a light bulb enables people to create spaces 
during nighttime that would otherwise be enveloped by darkness. He 
describes the light bulb as a medium without any content. McLuhan states
 that: "a light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence.  
Likewise, the message of a newscast about a heinous crime may be less 
about the individual news story itself – the content – and more about 
the change in public attitude towards crime that the newscast engenders 
by the fact that such crimes are in effect being brought into the home 
to watch over dinner… As society's values, norms and ways of doing 
things change because of the technology, it is then we realize the 
social implications of the medium.” </em><br><br> McLuhan somewhat humorously rephrased his famous aphorism as: <em>“The medium is the massage” </em>in recognition of the fact that each medium produces a different "massage" or "effect" on us.  Read more about McLuhan in <em>Wikipedia</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>
 We know that what McLuhan postulated is true today, intensified by the 
expansion of older technologies, TV and the Internet, and the advent of 
newer ones such as <em>Facebook</em> and <em>Twitter</em>.  The latter has added a powerful new dimension to political reporting because of its instantaneousness. <br><br> In his book <em>Sideshow: Dumbing Down Democracy</em>,
 (Scribe Publications, 2011) Lindsay Tanner asserts that the way the 
media now operates conditions the way politicians prepare for media 
interactions. A medium that is more interested in trivialities, 
conflict, gotchas, setting traps and creating discord, pushes 
politicians to behave defensively lest any slip up land them into 
political trouble or bring them into disrepute. <br><br> To elaborate on
 his assertion, he talks about TV, possibly now the major conduit for 
information to the public, and quotes media researcher John McManus’ 
four basic rules of TV news: <em>“prefer images above ideas, employ emotion above analysis, exaggerate, and avoid extensive news gathering”.</em> That does not leave much scope for intelligent statements about policy. <br><br> Tanner goes onto quote Robert MacNeil, former executive editor and co-anchor of a major US TV news show, who explains: <em>“The
 idea is to keep everything brief, not to strain the attention of anyone
 but instead provide constant stimulation through variety, novelty, 
action and movement… (assuming) that bite-sized is best, that complexity
 must be avoided, that nuances are dispensable, that qualifications 
impede the simple message, that visual stimulation is a substitute for 
thought, and that verbal precision is an anachronism.”</em> Where is the room for content in that formula? <br><br>
 With the medium dominating the scene and focussing attention on 
anything and everything but significant content, how can a politician 
hope to transmit anything at all complex, as indeed some policies of 
necessity must be?  Tony Abbott has grasped this reality with his three 
word slogans.  In his perpetual negative mode, he has the luxury of 
being able to reduce his negativity to short but memorable sound bites. 
 He exploits too the media’s preoccupation with images by pretending to 
sell bananas, by cutting up meat or by kissing fish.  It’s all too easy 
for the No, No, No, man and his GBNT. <br><br> Referring to the cult of the personality, Tanner quotes American commentator Michael Hirschorn: <em>“Mere logic is powerless against a brilliant projection of personality”. </em>Tanner goes on to say:<em>
 “Reporting of major events, such as federal budgets, is invariably 
reduced to a series of stories about aggrieved individuals.  Because 
news executives regard politics as boring, stories are rendered through 
individual life-experiences in order to make them more interesting. 
Journalist Dan Gardner suggests that ‘the power of personal stories 
explains the standard format of most feature reports in newspapers and 
television’ which in turn explains ‘the freak show that has taken over 
much of the media’.  The ultimate logic of this is that politicians 
become known for their personal characteristics and behaviour, not their
 policies.”</em> <br><br> So there it is – the real content, the real 
decisions of politicians on important aspects of policy that affects 
real people, are overwhelmed by the medium and its need or desire to 
meet other criteria for appealing to or entertaining its audience, such 
as human interest, sensation, travail, personalities, scandal, and 
trivialities that titillate.  Tony Abbott exploits this every day 
through his escapades at shopping centres, factories and mines, or 
driving heavy machinery. The consistent theme is: be scared, be fearful,
 the Labor dragon is about to slay you and change forever your way of 
life.  In contrast, the media, in pursuing its own agenda of 
infotainment, drowns out Julia Gillard’s good news messages with noise. <br><br> What do other commentators think about what Tanner asserts? <br><br> Jay Rosen, professor of journalism at New York University, interviewed by Tony Jones on <em><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2011/s3302557.htm" target="_blank">Lateline</a></em> last week, began by saying that ‘political coverage is broken’ and supported that assertion with: <em>“I
 think we've reached the point where politics as entertainment, the 
24-hour news cycle, the fascination with media manipulation and spin 
doctors, the cult of the insider in political coverage - have gone on 
for so long they've all come together to the point where I think they're
 not only distorting politics, but they're actually beginning to 
substitute for it.”</em> <br><br>Rosen went on to say: <em>“I think 
there was a time when the political system decided what policy was, what
 their stance was going to be, and then of course consulted their 
advisers about how to present it.  Today, as I think Lindsay Tanner 
suggested in his book Sideshow, which I have read, it's almost the 
reverse of that. It is, what's going to work in the media is presented 
first and then figuring out policies that you can announce that 
correspond to that comes after. </em><br><br><em> “It is that sense that
 this crazy mix of politics and news and manipulation and media and 
journalism has overtaken the political system that I think we need to 
register and start dealing with.” </em><br><br> Later Rosen said: <em>“…
 political actors respond to the intensive systems that are before them.
 I think what we have now is a situation where journalism isn't just 
representing what political actors do; it is actually changing what they
 do. And there isn't really an exit from that system no matter what 
channel you're watching or what news source you're consulting.”</em> Jones wanted to argue that this was a US phenomenon, but Rosen threw the question back at him: <em>“…tell me, Tony, do you not see any of these things happening in the Australian political system?”</em> Tony was having none of that, and went on to say: <em>“It
 is not coverage that's broken, rather it is the politicians themselves 
that are broken and what's broken in them is their ever-increasing use 
and reliance on spin.”</em> So Tony was sheeting the blame wholly to the politicians; the media was blameless. <br><br> But undeterred, Rosen came back: <em>“Well,
 that's true, they are doing that, and it is not just spin, it's focus 
groups, it's consultants, the notion of the permanent campaign, as I 
said before - but I think we're mature enough to recognise that 
political actors and the producers of news are interdependent at this 
point. </em><br><br><em> “Ask yourself this: who would be the most 
likely actor in that system to be able to change? Who has the most 
freedom of movement, the most freedom to manoeuvre? I would say it is 
the people in the news media. They could change their game tomorrow if 
they wanted to, and I think we're at the point where they ought to start
 thinking about doing that.”</em> <br><br> Tony was still unconvinced: <em>“Change
 their game in what way? It would be hard to imagine us changing our own
 game here on this program dramatically. We do long interviews; we do 
probing interviews with politicians. Hopefully we see through the spin. 
So what is it that you're suggesting should change?”</em> <br><br> Rosen explained patiently: <em>“What
 I mean by changing the game is first of all abandoning the fascination 
with "inside baseball" as we call it in the United States, or the media 
manipulators, and begin to return to journalism as a reality check.  A 
much heavier emphasis on fact-checking - calling out lies and 
distortions - would be a good start - but I think too much of the 
political press has begun to look at the public and electorate through 
the same eyes that professional operatives use when thinking of their 
next campaign. </em><br><br><em> “I think this kind of fascination with 
the mechanics of political presentation, staging, media narratives, 
appearing before the cameras and the arts of imagery - those kinds of 
things have become the mutual fascinations of the political class and 
the journalistic class. Maybe you avoid a lot of that on your program, 
but I think within the press culture as a whole in the United States 
and, according to Lindsay Tanner, in Australia, these values have begun 
to overtake the depiction of the real.”</em> <br><br> I’ve quoted at 
length what Jay Rosen had to say, as it was so germane.  But there was 
more.  You may wish to read the whole transcript or view this 
fascinating and informative interview.  <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2011/s3302557.htm" target="_blank">Click here</a>. &nbsp;<br><br> You also may wish to read his keynote address <em><a href="http://pressthink.org/2011/08/why-political-coverage-is-broken/" target="_blank">Why Political Coverage is Broken</a></em> to <em>New News 2011</em>,
 part of the Melbourne Writers Festival, co-sponsored by the Public 
Interest Journalism Foundation at Swinburne University of Technology in 
Melbourne on August 26. &nbsp;<br><br>Is it just slavish adherence of 
the media to a style of presentation that disadvantages those with a 
serious message, and assists those with a simple if disingenuous 
message?  In my opinion, there is more to it than that.  On any 
reasonable assessment of News Limited media it seems clear that there is
 a darker reason for PM Gillard and her ministers ‘not cutting through’.
  It is the deliberate distortion of the facts through omission, cherry 
picking and dishonesty that lie at the heart of the problem the 
Government has.  A media organization bent on ‘regime change’, which 
many believe is the case, can powerfully influence public opinion in 
whatever way it pleases, and News Limited does this overtly and 
covertly.  In my view it is not just the contemporary behaviour of the 
media that lies behind the Government’s problem; it is malevolence that 
descends from a proprietorial and editorial level. To assess the 
validity of that view, you may be interested to listen to <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-08-29/report-puts-megaphone-index-in-the-spotlight/2859764" target="_blank">Paul Barry talking today on ABC 24</a> about <em>Crikey’s</em> ‘megaphone index’.&nbsp;<br><br>
 The medium needs to be considered on a micro level too.  At an intimate
 interpersonal level in informal situations, such as we see in schools 
and supermarkets, Julia Gillard seems to be personable, likeable, good 
humoured and well regarded.  She has an infectious laugh and an engaging
 way of interacting with individuals.  She has no problems there.  Tony 
Abbott similarly does well in these environments. <br><br> At a more 
formal level in Press Club events or speeches or in press conferences, 
the PM comes across as more formal, more deliberate in what she says, 
and in how she answers questions.  She know that reporters are waiting 
to pounce on any perceived slip up or change of language as they did 
recently over the projected budget surplus in 2012/13.  She has learned 
that loose talk, or even an off-the-cuff remark, could be used by 
hostile journalists to beat her around the head. Although she controls 
questions firmly but politely, she has been branded by some as 
schoolmarmish.  On the other hand, journalists have learned that she 
will not take nonsense from them and will call them out.  Tony Abbott 
does not do nearly as well in press conferences.  He dislikes any 
challenge to his views, and when the questioning gets too tough or 
persistent for him, he winds up and walks out. <br><br> Both are workmanlike in delivering set speeches, but hardly Churchillian. <br><br>
 In parliament Julia Gillard can be persuasive, but also cutting in 
rebutting Coalition taunts, accusations and tricky questions.  She is 
Abbott’s superior in repartee, but both exhibit well-honed debating 
skills. <br><br> On occasions when dignity is needed she excels, as we 
have seen in her motions of condolence and in her responses to 
disasters, as does Tony Abbott. <br><br> Altogether I would give her 
high marks for communication, but most journalists would scoff at that 
assessment.  I would give lesser marks to Abbott, but acknowledge the 
success he has had with short memorable slogans. <br><br> Another 
component of the medium is the printed word.  This is still used, but to
 what effect?  The booklet recently distributed to all householders: <em>Working together for a clean energy future</em>,
 was an example of how not to inform the public.  Accustomed though I am
 to reading complex scientific documents, I found this one so confusing 
in its format, so boring to read, so dull in its layout, that I gave up a
 short way through.  It looked as if it had been produced by an earnest 
but unimaginative public servant, determined to include all the facts, 
and answer all the questions, if only readers looked long and patiently 
enough through its lacklustre pages.  It was wholly uninspiring. <br><br>
 I can’t claim to know the answer to producing documents that would 
appeal to the average voter, but what I understand about such attempts 
at ‘advertising’, is that ads are more likely to be read and understood 
if fashioned for consumption by children approaching teenage.  Perhaps a
 comic style format might attract readers.  It would be an interesting 
sociological study to research how many read the document, how much of 
it, how much they understood, and how much it affected their beliefs.  I
 predict the results would be very disappointing. <br><br> The <a href="http://www.cleanenergyfuture.gov.au/clean-energy-future/securing-a-clean-energy-future/" target="_blank">online version</a> was well set out and informative, but devoid of illustrations and graphics, which could have done so much to bring it alive. <br><br> <strong>The message</strong><br>
 It may seem odd that ‘the message’ comes so late in this piece, but the
 reality is that the message, the content of what politicians say, 
unless it can be reduced to slogan-like phrases, or bite-sized bits, or 
snappy TV clips, is of little interest to the media in its contemporary 
mood.  It is only through Government sponsored ‘advertising’ or 
information pieces that the Government can fashion its message.  
Unfortunately when it has done so, it has done it poorly. <br><br> <strong>Where does that leave us?</strong> <br>
 It is a sad reality that the imperatives of the commercial media to 
compete and turn a profit and the seeming desire of the public 
broadcaster to follow the pattern they set, leave us with a media that 
is not conducive to the promulgation of vitally important messages about
 policy, plans, budgets or decisions, unless they can be placed in fancy
 dress that appeals to a largely disinterested and inattentive 
electorate.  Politicians go through contortions to dress up their 
messages, which is relatively easy if they are negative and derogatory, 
but almost impossible if they are at all complex and will occupy much 
more than ten seconds of the audience’s attention.  The media, 
particularly the electronic media, has conditioned its users to short 
grabs, rapidly changing imagery, startling video, outrageous or 
scandalous utterances, and of course human interest stories, some heart 
warming, some grotesque.  There is simply no room for serious political 
content. <br><br> The transmission might be improved and the message enhanced, but the real problem seems to be with the medium. <br><br>
 The lost art of political communication seems fated to remain lost 
until and unless radical changes to media style are forthcoming, at 
least in the arena of political reportage.  As Jay Rosen said:  <em>“Who
 would be the most likely actor in that system to be able to change? Who
 has the most freedom of movement, the most freedom to manoeuvre? I 
would say it is the people in the news media. They could change their 
game tomorrow if they wanted to, and I think we're at the point where 
they ought to start thinking about doing that.”</em> And so say all of us. <br><br>
 But with media hell bent in pursuing its commercial and political 
agendas, and with an entrenched ‘We’re alright Jack’ attitude such as 
exhibited by Tony Jones last week where he laid full responsibility for 
the current ‘broken’ situation at the feet of spin-obsessed politicians,
 what hope have we got for change for the better?  Buckley’s, unless the
 Fifth Estate keeps hammering away at the Fourth Estate to change its 
ways and give us all a fair go in trying to grasp and understand what 
the Government is trying to do for this nation and its citizens.  How 
else can we thoughtfully cast a vote at the next election? <br><br> 
Unlike Tony Jones, this piece is not attempting to apportion blame, but 
to assign responsibility for the media mess we are in, and express the 
fervent hope that there is some way out of the abyss in which find 
ourselves trapped. <br><br> What do you think? <br><br></div></div>

  <p class="content">AA, hi. Its a bit rough on your excellent article 
to place here one of the final items from the Comments section of the 
previous thread, but I reckon it is germane to your theme, and may well,
 if it has the bombshell effect Glenn Milne clearly thinks that it will,
 engender a situation in which we will see much of the art of political 
communication at centre stage.

<br>PM A LOST CAUSE FOR WARRING UNIONS
<br>Australian, The (Australia) - Monday, August 29, 2011
<br>Author: GLENN MILNE
<br>
<br>Julia Gillard has lost all authority within the broader Labor movement
<br>
<br>THE real import of the alleged brothel creeping scandal surrounding 
Craig Thomson has been missed. And it is this: key factions and unions 
within the Labor movement are now openly indifferent to the fate of 
either Julia Gillard or the federal government. They simply don't care 
any more.
<br>
<br>Gillard has now lost all authority within the broader Labor 
movement. By their actions in the Thomson saga they have signalled a 
judgment that she cannot win the next election. Settling internal scores
 and power struggles is therefore now more important than whatever 
happens to a lame-duck PM who can't haul her primary voting numbers out 
of the pathetically fatal mid 20s.
<br>
<br>The Mafia-style dirt-covered shovel -- code for digging your own 
grave -- dumped on Friday at 3.30am on the doorstop of Kathy Jackson, 
the union official who had the courage to refer Thomson's activities to 
the police, may as well have been delivered to the Lodge. For Gillard it
 is now that bad. She is simply regarded as collateral damage and large 
sections in the Labor movement are uninterested about whether she's 
terminally wounded or not as they go about their internal bloodletting. 
It is about to get worse as elements of the Australian Workers' Union 
seek to settle up with Thomson's accusers by demonstrating that Gillard 
herself was implicated, albeit unknowingly, in a major union fraud of 
her own before she entered parliament.
<br>
<br>On Friday, Michael Smith of 2UE contacted me to check the veracity 
of material in a statutory declaration drawn up by Bob Kernohan, the 
former president of the AWU, and dealing with the relationship between 
Gillard and Bruce Wilson, which I outline below.
<br>
<br>On Saturday, Herald Sun and Daily Telegraph columnist Andrew Bolt 
wrote on his blog: ``On Monday, I'm tipping, a witness with a statutory 
declaration will come forward and implicate Julia Gillard directly in 
another scandal involving the misuse of union funds. Gillard herself is 
not accused of any misbehaviour at all. I do not make that claim, and do
 not hold that belief. But her judgment -- and that of at least one of 
her ministers -- will come under severe question. She will seem 
compromised. It could be the last straw for Gillard's leadership.''
<br>
<br>Big call. But I do have a good deal of knowledge regarding Bolt's 
claims. On Sunday November 11, 2007, just days before the November 24 
election I interviewed Gillard, then deputy leader of the opposition, in
 my capacity as political editor for News Limited's Sunday newspapers. 
The interview concerned the embezzlement of union funds -- not disputed 
-- and later the subject of a court conviction by a former boyfriend of 
Gillard, Bruce Wilson. I had researched the piece for months. It was the
 most heavily lawyered article I have ever been involved in writing. The
 story said that as a solicitor acting on instructions, she set up an 
association later used by her lover to defraud the AWU. But she has 
strenuously denied ever knowing what the association's bank accounts 
were used for.
<br>
<br>Gillard, then in her early 30s, was a lawyer with Melbourne-based 
Labor firm Slater &amp; Gordon. At the time of the fraud she acted for 
the AWU. She met Wilson, then the West Australian AWU secretary, while 
representing the union in the Industrial Relations Commission. Wilson 
later moved to Melbourne to become Victorian secretary of the union.
<br>
<br>``These matters happened between 12 and 15 years ago,'' Gillard told
 me. ``I was young and naive. I was in a relationship, which I ended, 
and obviously it was all very distressing. I am by no means the first 
person to find out that someone close turns out to be different to what 
you had believed them to be. It's an ordinary human error.
<br>
<br>``I was obviously hurt, when I was later falsely accused publicly of
 wrongdoing. I didn't do anything wrong and to have false allegations in
 the media was distressing.''
<br>
<br>What the lawyers would not allow to be reported was the fact that 
Gillard shared a home in Fitzroy bought by Wilson using the embezzled 
funds. There is or was no suggestion Gillard knew about the origin of 
the money. We now await the issue to which Bolt refers.
<br>
<br>If it comes, and if it is powerful as Bolt suggests, it will be 
further evidence that the Victorian Right represented by the AWU is 
involved in a life and death struggle with the Right as represented by 
the Hospital Services Union. Thomson was a senior official of the HSU 
for 20 years before entering parliament via the seat of Dobell.
<br>
<br>The HSU split several years ago into two factions. Thomson was 
supported by Jeff Jackson, Kathy Jackson's former husband. This 
so-called old guard was the support base for Victorian right-wing power 
boss, David Feeney. Feeney is now looking for a parliamentary seat 
because Gillard's abysmal numbers have made his third Senate spot 
vulnerable.
<br>
<br>A defeat for the old guard by way of a successful prosecution of 
Thomson by police, would leave Feeney powerless and without a base or a 
seat.
<br>
<br>Jackson himself has been accused of using union money on escorts 
with enemies of the Victorian HSU boss releasing bank statements showing
 payments to the same Sydney brothel where federal MP Thomson's credit 
card was allegedly used. Jackson has denied the claims. Ultimately at 
issue here could be the succession to Gillard, and I'll explain why.
<br>
<br>When Kathy Jackson called in the wallopers, the stakes were high. 
Because a federal defeat for Thomson and his allies would enhance the 
power base of Victoria's two other factional king makers, Bill Shorten 
and Stephen Conroy who are both aligned with the new guard in the HSU. 
And we all know what Shorten's ultimate ambition is.
<br>
<br>What a tangled web we weave especially when you consider Thomson is 
married to Zoe Arnold, a former Transport Workers Union official and 
adviser to former NSW Health Minister Reba Meagher. Alex Williamson, 
daughter of HSU national president Mike Williamson, is an adviser to 
Gillard. And, of course, as mentioned, Kathy Jackson, who blew the 
whistle on Thomson, was married to former Victorian state HSU secretary 
Jeff Jackson.
<br>
<br>Truly the NSW Disease has arrived in Canberra.
<br>
<br>Meanwhile amid all this interbred internecine manoeuvring Gillard 
attempts to adopt the high ground, attacking shadow attorney-general 
George Brandis for intervening in the course of justice. On Thursday 
morning Gillard attacked Brandis for speaking to NSW Police Minister 
Michael Gallacher at a time when the allegations against Thomson were 
being assessed by NSW Police. Unfortunately she got her facts wrong 
because the NSW police only announced they were conducting an assessment
 four days after Brandis spoke to Gallacher and in fact only got 
Brandis's dossier three days after he spoke to Gallacher.
<br>
<br>A small point but one that indicates the pressure is beginning to 
show on Gillard as she desperately searches for points of deflection. 
During the same press conference she also vainly tried to defend 
Thomson's decision not to make a statement to the parliament on the 
facts. We all know why; if he lies he's finished as an MP and Gillard is
 washed up as Prime Minister. Gillard and Thomson are shackled together 
just as surely as two First Fleet convicts.
<br>
<br>Oh, and here's a small postscript on which to end. On September 7 at
 the Wyong Christian School at 2pm there will be the opening of a new 
hall built with funds from Gillard's time overseeing the Building the 
Education Revolution. Thomson is scheduled to attend as the local 
member. My gut instinct is that both he and the Prime Minister will be 
otherwise engaged. </p>

<br>A trip down memory lane:
<br>
<br><cite title="Quote">Bolt from blue sets tongues wagging
<br>By Alan Ramsey
<br>March 25, 2006
<br>
<br>This was an old-fashioned bucket job, a list of 86 "examples" of 
what Faulkner saw as "10 years of unrelenting ministerial failure". For 
instance: "This Government and its hand-picked sycophants suffer from 
the worst case of collective amnesia in political history. What are its 
bywords after 10 years? 'I cannot recall', 'I do not recollect', 'I 
wasn't told' and 'I don't remember'. Best of all we had [former AWB 
chairman] Trevor Flugge claiming the defence of being 'hard of 
hearing'."
<br>
<br>But most titillating of all in Faulkner's litany of the Government's
 political and administrative abuses was example 62: "And what about the
 Nixonian leaking [in June, 2003] of a classified intelligence document 
to [Murdoch columnist] Andrew Bolt [of Melbourne's tabloid Herald Sun] 
in order to politically assassinate its author, [former intelligence 
analyst] Andrew Wilkie, while not vetoing the leaker from contesting a 
Liberal Party preselection [my emphasis]."
<br>
<br>Who could this possibly be?
<br>
<br>For 18 months the Faulkner/Ray duo pursued this question through the
 Senate's estimates hearings. Bolt's story ridiculing Wilkie, who 
resigned as an analyst from the Office of National Assessments in 
protest at the Government's decision to commit Australia to the military
 invasion of Iraq in March 2003, was published in the Herald Sun on June
 23, 2003. The story quoted from a report Wilkie had written in December
 2002, before his resignation the following March.
<br>
<br>Faulkner set down in the Senate the chronology of what followed, on 
June 23 last year - the anniversary of the Bolt article. He said: "We 
have been able to piece together, through committee hearings, what 
happened to Wilkie's report. It was written in December 2002. It was 
issued to a restricted list. All authorised copies were later returned 
and logged in accordance with ONA procedures for classified material.
<br>
<br>"Then, six months later, on 20 June 2003, Mr Downer's office 
requested a copy - the only such request during the six months period. 
Three days later, on 23 June - a year ago today - Mr Bolt published his 
article. If the ONA handling system is worth its salt, it should reveal 
which of the original copies of the report were returned and when; and 
which copies, if any, remain with recipients.
<br>
<br>"It should also reveal who in Mr Downer's office requested a copy 
and if and when it was returned. Surely we can establish who that person
 in Mr Downer's office was."
<br>
<br>Well, federal police said no, they could not do that. At least, this
 is what John Howard's junior Minister for Justice, Chris Ellison, told 
us at the time. Five days before Faulkner's June 23 chronology in the 
Senate, Ellison issued a one-sentence statement late in the afternoon of
 Friday, June 18, 2004. The statement said: "The Australian Federal 
Police have concluded there is no direct admissible evidence to identify
 any of the recipients of the report as the source of the disclosure to 
the journalist Andrew Bolt." Full stop, ends.
<br>
<br>No "direct admissable evidence".
<br>
<br>What a wondrous phrase.
<br>
<br>Along the way we'd learnt the Government had referred the Bolt 
article to the federal police in July 2003 - the month following its 
publication. It took police exactly 11 months to come back to the 
Government and say, like Manuel, they knew nothing. That they'd not been
 able to learn the identity of the leaker - in Downer's office, or 
anywhere else.
<br>
<br>All this, of course, occurred just months before the November 
election that year. And when Faulkner tried to push Ellison in the 
Senate to learn exactly what was meant by "no direct admissable 
evidence", he got nowhere.</cite>

  <p class="content">Michael
<br>Thanks to you and Jason and NormanK for posting the Milne article, 
so typical of that dirt-digging man.&nbsp;&nbsp; It does support the 
contention of this piece that some sections of the media, apart from 
failing to report the facts truthfully and fully, is campaigning 
strongly to remove the elected Government by whatever dirty underhand 
methods it has at its disposal.
<br>
<br>I will be interested to see the extent to which the apology emanating from <em>The Australian</em> is publicized.&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew Bolt has it on his website: 
<br>
<br>“<em> Milne’s story is removed from the Australian’s website and an apology is printed:  
<br>
<br>THE AUSTRALIAN published today an opinion piece by Glenn Milne which
 includes assertions about the conduct of the Prime Minister. The 
Australian acknowledges these assertions are untrue. The Australian also
 acknowledges no attempt was made by anyone employed by, or associated

<br>
<br>Urgent re Glenn Milnes article:
<br>
<br>Would you mind removing my last post on other thread.
<br>It seems Dave Gaukroger has removed his page and Newsbank have 
removed their page.&nbsp;&nbsp;This commenter below at Oz Politics says 
there is a legal ban on Publication

<br>
<br>Thanks to a post at Crikey, I have tracked down and saved a verbatim
 quote but they were reluctant to post a link and I'm not sure whether I
 should do so here...
<br>
<br>I understand that there are links in the twittersphere too...
<br>
<br>Apparently, there is a <strong>legal ban on publication and re-publication </strong>-
 but there is at least one high profile journalist who is prepared to 
risk keeping the allegations up on his blog - he's attempting to do so 
via the technicality of saying that he's not sure whether it is true...

<br>Your post on the last piece has been deleted at your request.
<br>
<br>It seems as if Milne has really put his nasty foot in it big 
time.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can imagine him writing such a malicious piece - it's
 his long suit - and I can imagine him doing so without checking his 
facts, but what is reprehensible is <em>The Oz</em> publishing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Heads should roll at an editorial level, as well as Milne's head itself.</p>

  <p class="content"><cite title="Quote">What do you think? </cite>
<br>
<br>A useful post Ad astra...you've certainly put a great deal of work in. 
<br>
<br>When focusing on communication ya have to think about specific 
audience demographics. Target audiences. Take for instance 
hairdressers...or contractors/service delivery people working from their
 vans/small trucks...or factory workers...where do they get their 
info/news? Often radio. And word of mouth.
<br>
<br>If the majority of them watch some kind of corporate news in the 
morn &amp; night before...listen to some kind of corporate radio 
station...obviously the messages they receive are going to be littered 
w/ bias based on commercial requirements of those corporate media organs
 that are selecting, filtering, creating, distorting the news/facts for 
them.
<br>
<br>The more corporate media you have...the more competing messages are 
drowned out. The public interest or public value is transformed into 
corporate interest. The public are corporatised. 
<br>
<br>If large companies are permitted to merge, take-over and consolidate
 they can become cost-effective...but also become multi-tentacled 
creatures that use the corporate media to promote their wares...but also
 help sustain the corporate media by way of advertising and even owning 
shares.
<br>
<br>This leads to infotainment:
<br>
<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infotainment" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infotainment</a>
<br>
<br>But also a tendency for talking heads to focus on news stories that 
fit the agendas of those who own the main shares &amp;/or govern in the 
news company/media organisation...or the main editors/gatekeepers. 
<br>
<br>It's important for them to avoid offending advertisers if 
possible...and promote ways for their organisations to grow &amp; 
profit. That growth/profit helps reporters &amp; talking heads and other
 essential behind the scenes staff get pay rises and bonuses and to hold
 onto their job. 
<br>
<br>It's unlikely that many will buck the system...or be given much latitude.
<br>
<br>Consequently, corporate news stories oft lean towards criticising 
governments &amp; unions that want to increase taxes on large 
companies...make staffing and wage arrangements less flexible...want 
more regulation of business, including media ownership...push for more 
focus on top end tax dodgers (unless it's the competition bein' 
pursued)...and so on.
<br>
<br>But these media organisations also know their audience 
demographics...so they will cater to a "workchoices is bad" story if 
they feel essential target audiences will turn to competition if they 
don't run it. 
<br>
<br>This does not mean tho they will not incrementally try to shift 
public opinion towards their profiteering agendas down the road. 
<br>
<br>As we now see happening w/ the new &amp; old guard Libs &amp; think 
tankers bein' pushed out there to promote the benefits of further IR 
(industrial relations) reform. And tax cuts. And cuts in spending that 
don't benefit them and their advertisers/shareholders.
<br>
<br>Consequently, a rich mining heiress owning part of a TV network and 
having influence over staff selection can see her &amp; the mining 
sector's interests being pushed more often than that of a government 
that wants to tax super profits of mining companies...and if staff 
resist, they might find themselves out on their arses down the 
road...unless they attract huge audiences, get good ratings and help 
bring in the cream. 
<br>
<br>To offset this problem more biased, sycophantic talking heads will 
be brought in...such as Bolt...to get the mining company message out. 
Even tho the mining companies and supporters can use ads thruout the 
year to promote their views...whilst some governments are cornered on 
trying do do same.
<br>
<br>This is why it is important to have less commercialised &amp; politicised media, such as public radio, TV &amp; internet.
<br>
<br>And a generally less commercially driven blogosphere &amp; 
university media training centres that can be drawn upon by the public 
media. 
<br>
<br>It's also important that students at school receive a comprehensive education in media &amp; communication analyses. 
<br>
<br>They need to be empowered...the same way individuals need to learn 
about business, finance &amp; technology...and how to see thru 
scams/cons...and make educated, informed choices.

  <p class="content">Hi AA
<br>
<br>Agree about heads at the Oz should roll but would be surprised if it
 were to happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most likely Milne will go to the bench for a
 while. He is almost as annoying as his namesake Stephen Milne to 
continue the metaphor. 
<br>
<br>But I also thought, how did this get published?&nbsp;&nbsp;OK if it 
were someones blog where they simply push a button and "there it 
is".&nbsp;&nbsp;From how I understand a newspaper like the Oz works 
there would be Sub Editors checking the material to be 
published.&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely an inflammatory piece like this involving 
the PM would set off flags to have some double checks done, check it 
with legal dept etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I understand there was not a 
scoop here that had to be rushed out, so they could have waited another 
day or so to check the facts.
<br>
<br>That it was published reinforces the impression that the Oz sees 
itself as a player in politics.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not interested in 
merely providing the medium.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<br>It amazes me that these characters like Richo, Alan Jones, Andrew

<br>Thank you for your thoughtful additions to this piece.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
 course shock jocks and columnists like top megaphone Andrew Bolt, have a
 profound influence on their own audiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;They follow the 
same rules as do TV bulletins and current affair programs – keep the 
message short and simple, prefer the trivial, the personal, the ‘human 
interest’ story, and avoid complexity, nuance and rational 
analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Checking factual accuracy is not seen as important –
 the entertainment value is all that counts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bolt’s articles 
are brief and written with the assurance of someone who never doubts his
 invincibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;Facts and accuracy are irrelevant as Alan 
Jones and Ray Hadley demonstrate every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>As Jay Rosen says: <em>“I think we've reached the point where 
politics as entertainment, the 24-hour news cycle, the fascination with 
media manipulation and spin doctors, the cult of the insider in 
political coverage - have gone on for so long they've all come together 
to the point where I think they're not only distorting politics, but 
they're actually beginning to substitute for it.”</em> 
<br>
<br>That is what is happening through the MSM, whether via print, blog, 
radio or TV.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a sad but stark reality we have to accept 
and counter as well as we are able.

  <p class="content">Bear with me.
<br>
<br>About 8 years ago I had the great fortune to gain seasonal 
employment at a wilderness camp, off the Gibb River Rd in the Kimberley 
region of W.A. During my time off I would head for one particular 
billabong. One that was not open to the tourists. It was about a three 
kilometre slog through some pretty rough country to get there, after a 
fifteen km drive. What did I do when I got there?...I just sat.
<br>
<br> I sat there watching the double bar finches squabble among 
themselves. The crimson, zebra and star finches seemed to be much more 
refined, as were the pardelotes and purple crowned fairy wrens. The 
gouldians,a cautious and aloof bird, paid no heed to any.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The longer I sat there the more the billabong seemed to absorb me into 
its tapestry. To hear the dainty slurping of a doe and her joey as they 
drink, a whistling of the raptor kites wings as it swoops upon a slow 
hapless finch. The low vibralto honk of brolgas as they tread delicately
 through the savanah grass. By absorbing all of this, and much more, the
 billabong made me a part of itself. And it of me.
<br>
<br>By pure fortunate happenstance I think the Gillard minority Govt. 
has led us to a billabong. As a country and a people we just need to sit
 awhile. To tune out from the cacophony of confected outrage and 
vitriolic intent. We need it.
<br>
<br>No-one can't force us to look at the billabong. Though we need aware of its existence. </p>

<br>
<br>What a lovely comment, thankyou.&nbsp;&nbsp;I like that Billabong you sat at, it sounds absolutely beautiful.
<br>
<br>If we become too invoved with the confected outrage we will make 
ourselves as bad as the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;But my wish is someone would 
tell 
<br>Abbott, his cheers squad, his shock jocks, his journalists, all 
"Just Shut Up".&nbsp;&nbsp;Honestly they have gone crazy, Julia Gillard 
did everything even got born, what 48 years ago.

  <p class="content">Hi Lyn
<br>Thank you for the <em>mumbrella</em> link; there seems to be some who are running scared over the Milne piece.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in <em>The Australian</em>
 in print, so as it is already out there it is not going to be possible 
to contain the story.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a difference between endorsing
 the veracity of the story, as Bolt might be doing, and simply 
reproducing it without endorsement or comment, as do those who carry it 
unedited as simply a record of what happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be 
interesting to see how this plays out.&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been no 
mention of the piece or the apology in the news that I have heard 
today.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Jon Faine on 774 Melbourne ABC radio who first 
drew attention to the Milne article and when the apology came in he 
interrupted his program to read it to his listeners.
<br>
<br>I wonder will the TV news mention it or the current affairs 
programs, or will there be an attempt to bury it as it is so damaging to
 <em>The Australian</em>, Glen Milne and to those using it to discredit 
the PM and her Government.&nbsp;&nbsp;This could backfire badly on the 
perpetrators, unless of course it is buried by the media, which I 
suspect is what might happen.

<br>At your request I have deleted your comment at 11.12 am on the last piece.
<br>
<br>I note that on the Bolt blog the essence of the Milne piece is still there: <a href="http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/whats_williamson_so_scared_of" rel="nofollow">blogs.news.com.au/.../whats_williamson_so_scared_of</a> 
<br>
<br>It's in the printed version of <em>The Australian</em>, so the story can't be contained.&nbsp;&nbsp;However we must ensure that we on <em>TPS</em> do not endorse the story or in any way vouch for its accuracy.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>Who would be imprudent enough to endorse anything Milne wrote?</p>

<br>The link to the Milne piece from <em>wotnews</em> that I get each morning, now leads to a 404 error ‘Page not found’.
<br><a href="http://wotnews.com.au/view/7201148/05d58e6ef989279805c60f5e4e66cbf3/" rel="nofollow">wotnews.com.au/.../</a> 
<br>
<br><em>The Australian</em> has a ‘Correction’ in the top right corner of the online version. <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaustralian.com.au/</a> It is the first of six items under ‘Opinion’.
<br>
<br>When one clicks on it the following correction is seen:
<br>
<br>“<em> THE AUSTRALIAN published today an opinion piece by Glenn Milne
 which includes assertions about the conduct of the Prime Minister.
<br>
<br>“The Australian acknowledges these assertions are untrue. The 
Australian also acknowledges no attempt was made by anyone employed by, 
or associated with, The Australian to contact the Prime Minister in 
relation to this matter.
<br>
<br>“The Australian unreservedly apologises to the Prime Minister and to its readers for the publication of these claims.”</em>

<br>
<br><em>The Australian</em> seems to be running scared.&nbsp;&nbsp;There
 may be more to come on how this story came to be written and published,
 unless News Limited buries it, as I suspect they will.

<br>Sorry if I seemed alarmist but I imagine that those sites which 
specialise in providing links would have legal advisors and that they 
seem to have recommended distancing themselves from this whole affair.
<br>It certainly has caused a stir hasn't it? At the very least one editor's neck must be on the block.</p>

<br>This coincidental episode reinforces what this piece maintains – 
that not only is the much of the media, particularly News Limited, 
culpable for misreporting and distorting the facts about the performance
 of PM Gillard and her Government, it is maliciously attempting to run 
it out of office through the promulgation of innuendo, outright lies and
 what it believes is scandal.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Milne article is a 
flagrantly obscene example of this.

<br>Ad Astra, isn't it possible that it was endorsed by senior

done.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't be undone.&nbsp;&nbsp;News Ltd. would wear the

<br>It's no coincidence that all this is happening as the government's

 better way to stop it developing into a surge of support for the Prime

<br>I’m keeping an eye on this – while Bolt continues to publicize the 
essence of the Milne missive, and indeed endorse it, it seems as if it 
is still extant.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it disappears from the Bolt site, we will
 need to review the situation.

<br>
<br>Thank you for another great article.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have become 
addicted to Jay Rosen since Lyn first linked to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;With 
your piece and his advice to the media, you would think someone would 
listen and take on board what he is saying.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead the 
media, just like they did straight after Lindsay Tanner's book, 
Sideshow, came out they all went on the attack and got worse, if that 
was possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Ian
<br>
<br>What a great little saying.&nbsp;&nbsp;I try to keep myself away from the political scene but am not succeeding.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Nas
<br>
<br>Keep it coming, I look forward to your input.
<br>
<br>Trevor
<br>
<br>I can sympathise&nbsp;&nbsp;with your frustration.&nbsp;&nbsp;At 
least we can come here and vent our frustration and not just let it all 
build up inside.</p>

<br>
<br><cite title="Quote">Of course shock jocks and columnists like top 
megaphone Andrew Bolt, have a profound influence on their own 
audiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;They follow the same rules as do TV bulletins and 
current affair programs – keep the message short and simple, prefer the 
trivial, the personal, the ‘human interest’ story, and avoid complexity,
 nuance and rational analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Checking factual accuracy is 
not seen as important</cite>
<br>
<br>So true. And the problem w/ a media providing news &amp; political 
commentary that have commercial imperitives is the need to get ratings, 
audiences and advertising. 
<br>
<br>It means that some of the commentators/talking heads will 
fear-monger &amp; say controversial things in order to attract 
attention.
<br>
<br>Not unlike Tony Abbott. He did work in this industry. 
<br>
<br>Tony Abbott, like Rupert Murdoch, puts opportunism above all else.
<br>
<br>Definition of opportunism:
<br><cite title="Quote">the art, policy, or practice of taking advantage
 of opportunities or circumstances often with little regard for 
principles or consequences.</cite>
<br>(merriam-webster.com/dictionary)
<br>
<br>Imagine Australia run by Tony Abbott w/ the assistance of the Murdoch empire. 
<br>
<br>A country run by weathervanes...using the morning newspapers to set 
the scarey item of the day, OZsterity, union &amp; teacher &amp; youth 
&amp; Greens bashing, pro-IR changes, luv-in w/ Coalition sycophant of 
the mth, go police state, Tony is benevolent ruler agenda...
<br>
<br>the messages amplified by the shock jock megaphones and a few lower key ABC types...
<br>
<br>drilled further into the public consciousness by SKY NEWS agenda 
thruout the day...and posters across the city...and fridge magnets, 
pamphlets, YouTube animation...
<br>
<br>and by way of church leaders...and business speakers...and other 
forums including The National Press Club...and panels on late night TV 
shows...
<br>
<br>add regular surveys massaged by astroturfing...and polls based on target voters...and right-wing blogs...
<br>
<br>and before ya know it you've got a country swayed by 
weathervanes...pushing whatever agendas benefit them at the time...and 
secures their influence &amp; power. 
<br>
<br>And their main supporters will have a field day. 
<br>
<br>Rampant capitalism w/ spurts of Christian prosperity evangelism 
&amp; the Pope as pop figure &amp; over-the-top zionism and misogyny 
&amp; brutal ockerism by way of sports and music...
<br>
<br>and anti-intellectualism and selfish libertarianism and 
gay/refugee/muslim-bashing and nuclear power &amp; coal promotion and 
the "dumbing down" mach whatever will dominate.
<br>
<br>W/ a preachy approach to the unemployed and Aborigines. Guilt guilt guilt.
<br>
<br>One for Mum, one for Dad, and one for the country/corporations/wars/taxman. 
<br>
<br>W/ Tony grinning, whooping, chasing kids like an ecstatic 19th 
century London minister cum industrialist...long coat flowing, skin 
tight on skull...teeth bared.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>Thank you for your kind remarks.&nbsp;&nbsp;You are right – so much 
of the media remains in denial about the role it plays in political 
reportage and how much it influences opinion about politics, instead of 
it being what it ought to be, a faithful purveyor of facts that voters 
can use to make decisions at the polling booth.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was 
gobsmacked to hear Tony Jones say to Jay Rosen: “<em>It is not coverage 
that's broken, rather it is the politicians themselves that are broken 
and what's broken in them is their ever-increasing use and reliance on 
spin.” </em>&nbsp;&nbsp;What hope is there for change when a prominent 
journalist like Jones believes he and the media are blameless and it’s 
all the politicians’ fault?&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <p class="content">Ad astra, absolutely right about Ltd News, whose 
owner's corrupt influence is writ large over every lying distortion 
about the Labor government printed in the last 2+ years and every 
sycophantic, sickening fawning free pass given to Sir Liealot (nods to 
FS). 
<br>
<br>No wonder the PM has trouble "getting her message out" or "cutting 
through" all the msm bullsh!t, lies, obfuscations and distortions.
<br>
<br>And his malevolent and corrupting influence has infected every facet of the media, including the ABC.
<br>
<br>Makes Tony Jones's defensive nonsense look even more nonsensical.

<br>The picture you paint is unnerving.&nbsp;&nbsp;The thought of this 
particular Coalition being in government, with luminaries like Joe 
Hockey and Barnaby Joyce being in charge of finance, Christopher Pyne 
running education, Peter Dutton health, and Julie Bishop foreign 
affairs, is scary enough, but not nearly as frightening and dangerous as
 Tony Abbott, with all his grotesque baggage, his warped ideologies and 
his weathervane opportunistic approach to governance, as our next 
PM.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <p class="content">The greater fear of Abbott in the Lodge is that he 
would cease to be a weather vane.&nbsp;&nbsp;With George Pell, who is 
not shy of interfering in the politics of the country as a virtual 
cabinet member.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we could expect adherence to some 
very strict policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;All that science tosh would be the 
first to go.

<br>
<br>Ad astra, the thought of Liealot's Coalition even being in charge of
 a pub meat raffle is frightening enough. To let them loose on a country

  <p class="content">Folks
<br>Can you make any sense of the results in this table in today's 
Essential Report in the face of Labor's poor polling - TPP 56/44 this 
week in Essential?&nbsp;&nbsp;Apologies for the formatting.
<br>
<br>How can those polled give the Government a mark of over 50% in every
 category except sending asylum seekers to Malaysia and the carbon tax, 
and mark it down so far in the TPP?&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government is 
doing so well on 12 of the 14 parameters, why are those polled not 
giving them a stronger vote?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the asylum seeker issue and 
the carbon tax so bad in their eyes that they cancel out all the other 
good things they are doing?

  <p class="content">TT excellent pome. 
<br>
<br>Ad astra, it's like the polls are suffering from multiple personality disorder. 
<br>
<br>Those results are baffling in the extreme-even Liberal voters gave a
 big tick to half of the items, including 54% approval of management of 
the economy. 
<br>
<br>Yet there's that 12% gap in the TPP. I can't believe that the 
Malaysian Solution and the Carbon price would skew the TPP so much.
<br>
<br>Could it be that those polled are somehow dissociating the policies they so strongly approve with the government? </p>

  <p class="content">Apparently Tony Abbott in a speech today put a knife in Julie Bishop's back, yet again.
<br>
<br>He gave a shout out to Josh Frydenberg: "It's nice to have someone 
in the parliamentary party who understands foreign affairs at last".
<br>
<br>More from the Alan Ramsey piece I linked to above:
<br>
<br><cite title="Quote">The rub, of course, is Kooyong already has a 
sitting MP: one of Malcolm Fraser's old staffers, Petro Georgiou, who 
worked for 20 years for the Liberal Party before he came into Parliament
 12 years ago. Frydenberg's is the fourth challenge Georgiou has faced. 
Alexander Downer has been busy on his former adviser's behalf since well
 back last year. Georgiou's political mates are now making a lot of 
media noise to catch up.
<br>
<br>Radio's Alan Jones took Malcolm and Tammy Fraser to dinner at 
Melbourne's Crown Casino on Tuesday night, along with a number of 
Fraser's former prime ministerial staff. Georgiou was among them. So was
 David Kemp, the former Howard cabinet minister. There was a lot of chat
 about the Frydenberg challenge. Georgiou is a tough nut but he is under
 pressure. We will learn the outcome on April 23.</cite>

<br>
<br>My little furry web-savvy cobber Brucie the Bilby wrote a Big Book of educational ecology called 
<br> 
<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Breeze in the Blue~Gums</span>. 
<br>
<br>It's more than 20 000 words in tightly rhymed verse, but you might 
like the introduction, as I enjoyed your description of your billabong. 
<br>
<br> 
<br>These are the rhymes 
<br>Of the lives and the times
<br>Of the Fauna of Billabong Tree
<br>Where Breezes tell Blue-Gums
<br>In murmurs and mimes
<br>Of a Wide Brown Land 
<br>Which was once Free.
<br>
<br>Where the Rainbow Snake created
<br>As the Dreamtime dreamers dreamed:
<br>As the patient aeons waited,
<br>We Native Fauna teemed:
<br>But
<br>Our Dreamtime dream was broken
<br>By ‘White’ Men, in ships, and hats – 
<br>And we found we had awoken
<br>To Guns, Fire, Dogs – and Cats.
<br>
<br>To a world of ploughs, and Sheep and Cows; of graziers in khaki collars
<br>Who reckon all that heaven allows in terms of dirt and dollars:-
<br>But on top of all the loss of native Faunal habitat
<br>There’s one who notches a “Gotcha!” Cross each time it KILLS: The Cat!
<br>
<br>For though many creatures kill to live, from the Blue Whale to the Krill,
<br>The savage pet “domestic” Cat is the one which lives to kill:
<br>We Fauna of Wide Brown Land must find some means, if we can,
<br>To teach Humans to Save Our Species – So, we’ve come up with a PLAN.
<br>
<br>Ancient Jo, the Mopoke, teaches: “We must reach all the youth!”
<br>Whether you surf the Net, or beaches, we must teach you all the Truth.
<br>IF SOMEDAY YOU WANT YOUR YOUNG ONES TO SEE US, SAVE US NOW!
<br>[HIST! The Breezes in the Blue~Gums are whispering: “Here’s How!”]
<br>
<br>Let Platypus play!
<br> Let Koala-Trees sway!
<br> Let Billabong Fauna roam free!
<br>Let us strive for the day
<br>When Humans will say
<br>In Wide Brown Land:
<br>
<br>“ LIFE – LET IT BE!”
<br>
<br>
<br>The first chapter of the poem proper is called,
<br>"The Meeting at Billabong Tree."
<br>
<br>You'd like to be there. The Fauna hold one every year now. </p>

<br>You query that the PM was born 48 years ago.
<br>
<br>In fact in exactly a month's time, Julia Gillard will turn 50. She was born on 29 September, 1961.
<br>
<br>It is not a sitting week so she may disappear for a private 
celebration. Apart from being the first female PM, I've often wondered 
if she might not also be amongst the youngest as well.</p>

<br>
<br>And for all the other links &amp; useful comments &amp; quotes. Top job. Per usual.
<br>
<br>BTW, above I spelt commercial imperatives incorrectly.
<br>
<br>I noticed on The Drum that author of Compassionate Bastard, Peter 
Mitchell, also mentioned commercial imperatives...when it came to the 
running of Villawood Detention Centre post-privatisation. Apparently 
they did not improve accountability and the whole system was driven by 
it. People as numbers. KERCHING. 
<br>
<br>We've seen what commercial imperatives have done for livestock, including live exports.
<br>
<br>And for the public interest when it comes to the media.
<br>
<br>And for protecting our environment when it comes to big oil (Alaska,
 BHP oil spill, QLD coast), coal (mine disasters, global warming, 
nuclear energy (Japan) &amp; gas (Gasland doco).
<br>
<br>Some companies do a damn good job...but the sharemarket demands can 
create unrealistic expectations...demands for more and more 
profits...and cost cutting...and risk taking.

  <p class="content">When looking at the additional polling figures 
something becomes quite clear. This Govt. is doing a great job. These 
figures a precisely why the level of poison by the Murdock Liberal party
 has increased dramatically. Personally, I think that the MLP has more 
problems on its plate than Labor has....and both parties know it.
<br>
<br>Consider this;
<br>
<br>NBN...will get done.
<br>MRRT..will get passed.
<br>Carbon tax...will get passed.
<br>Superannuation increase...will get passed.
<br>Plain packaging for tobacco...passed. And it will be taken up around the world.
<br>Asylum seekers..will never be resolved to the satisfaction of 
anyone, anywhere, anytime soon. The regional program will be 
implemented, in way or the other, globally. It's a global problem and 
the only solution would be an unprecedented outbreak of world 
peace...good luck with that.
<br>
<br>In short? Everything the neo-cons have instructed Abbott to destroy 
is going stronger than when the policies were first mooted. All that he 
has touched has failed. Miserably. The laws have been drafted, passed 
through, or are about to be passed through the parliament of Australia. 
They will extremely hard, nigh impossible to rescind.
<br>
<br>This presents problem another for the neo-cons. When they dispose of
 Abbott who replaces him? If Abbott can't gain Govt. with toxicity and 
poison who can? None of his front bench impress. Not even Turnbull. 
Abtez and Gretch have seen to that. Another leader will have to debate 
policy and ideology. Never big on policy neo-cons are never going to go 
down the road of an ideological debate. There are somethings that wont 
stand up to the light of scrutiny.
<br>
<br>While the political battle is still raging, the real war, the war of
 governance, has been won by Labor. Fittingly, the latest poll figures 
show that.
<br>
<br>Julia Gillard knows it. Tony Abbott knows it....and so do the people who own him.

  <p class="content">Good ole Wikipedia. Where else would you look for 
the age on appointment of all Australian Prime Ministers! (a question I 
posed @ 07:09 PM).

<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Australian_Prime_Ministers_by_age" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/.../List_of_Australian_Prime_Ministers_by_age</a> 
<br>
<br>Of the 27 Australian PMs, Julia is the 9th youngest at the time of swearing in by the Governor-General.
<br>
<br>Chris Watson, our third PM was the youngest at 37 years &amp; 18 
days. Billy McMahon, our 20th PM, was the oldest at 63 years and 15 
days.
<br>
<br>The eight 'youngsters' in order of age were:
<br>
<br>Chris Watson, b 1867 (37)
<br>Stanley Bruce, b 1883 (39)
<br>Robert Menzies, b 1894 (44)

  <p class="content">Hi, All
<br>
<br>Milne gives journalists a bad name. He wants to be the Alan Jones of newsmedia, but isn't that "good".
<br>
<br>The Australian has largely given up any pretence it once had of being balanced in its reporting.
<br>
<br>In terms of communication, there are two factors that I consider 
important: leadership and passion. Julia Gillard is not a natural 
leader, and relies too much on reason, and shows not enough passion in 
her speeeches and arguments.
<br>
<br>It's nice to find a little time to read some news / posts.

  <p class="content">Ad Astra,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In answer to your 
question about the Essential poll. I think it's a form of political 
Cognitive Dissonance.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; When asked about 'the government', people reflected 
well upon them. However, when asked who they would prefer to vote for, 
it's certainly not the ALP.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;When out and about in the car this afternoon I listened 
to an informative discussion about politics between John Hewson, Tanya 
Pliberseck, and Wendy McCarthy(and, did you know that Dr John Hewson's 
father was a Fitter and Turner, and John, like so many children of the 
Whitlam era, was the first in his family to be able to go to 
University...So, what does he do? Join the Liberal Party, ungrateful so 
and so). Anyway, along with Richard Glover, they were all discussing the
 woeful polling and Julia's poor standing with the electorate and 
whether it was terminal or not, and, if not, how she may be able to turn
 the numbers around before the next election. Well, Wendy McCarthy came 
out with the most rational response. She said that if there were to be 
moves on a couple of the issues that the polling also says that the 
majority of the electorate are in favour of, such as Same Sex Marriage 
and Poker Machine Gambling Addiction Reform, then it may well be a case 
of quite a fast turnaround in opinion of the PM. Which is in weird 
contradistinction to the fact of the concerted campaign by the Clubs 
Industry having what is perceived to be a devastating effect out in the 
community right now on the government's popularity. The key to the 
turnaround , which can be made to happen, is that the government has to 
find a way to break the nexus in the community's mind between the 
benefit from the Clubs' money on local sport and community enterprises, 
and what the Clubs are getting away with due to the Hospital Pass they 
are given by the community for this quid pro quo. Simply, the government
 has to find a way to plug that financial hole with the money that the 
Clubs Industry keep threatening to take away if they are not going to be
 allowed to keep ripping off Problem Gamblers. I think if they can do 
that they will get a big tick from the community.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as Same Sex Marriage goes, I think I've been 
right all along about the solution to this one. Simply, again(and all 
political solutions need to be simple in this day of the shortened 
attention span), the government can make provision to allow Same Sex 
'Marriage', however, if the Churches decide they do/don't want to 
sanctify those 'marriages' within the walls of their Churches, then 
that's a matter for them to decide. Same Sex Weddings in Public places 
and Registry Offices, there should be no problems with allowing that. 
However, it shouuld be a Conscience vote for both sides of politics
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, with the Climate Change and MRRT legislation 
finally becoming a reality, and no longer the stuff of the nightmares 
that Sir Liealott is retailing to the electorate(and I note a major plus
 here with the release of the first Private Enterprise, Multinational 
Corporation, Feel Good ad in favour of Climate Change action, coming 
over the weekend to our TVs from GE), then the political blowback will 
start to blow the Weathervane around instead.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I hope so.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, wrt the Glenn Milne article and The 
Australian's response. Well, as there is no true accountability for this
 sort of thing anymore, I don't think it's going to stop any time soon. 
Glenn Milne may be sent to Purgatory at the ABC for 6 months again, but 
probably not. He and The Austrollian will just brazen it out because 
they know the PM has no real power to force change against them through 
the parliament. And the Media (Self) Regulator is just a toothless 
tiger. And they know that too. They need to be taken down a peg or two 
but there's no way to effect it. And, anyway, the real nigger in the 
woodpile, Andrew Bolt is still without sanction or control from 
anywhere, sadly.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, back to the World Athletics Championships(sorry it's an addiction worse than politics for me). TTFN. <img src="political-sword_files/smiley-smile.gif" class="flag" alt="Smile"></p>

  <p class="content">Ad,
<br>I am puzzled by your comment @ 4:19 PM
<br>
<br>Before I go on. I did not see or listen to the interview with Rosen.
 I have only read the transcript which I have no reason to believe is 
inaccurate.
<br>
<br><em>I was gobsmacked to hear Tony Jones say to Jay Rosen:
<br>(Let me put that to you, though, an alternative theory.) It is not 
coverage that's broken, rather it is the politicians themselves that are
 broken and what's broken in them is their ever-increasing use and 
reliance on spin.</em>
<br>
<br>Jones is putting an alternative. To presume that he firmly believes 
that theory and therefore he totally believes, as you state, <em>... he and the media are blameless and it’s all the politicians’ fault</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;illustrates part of the problem.
<br>
<br>Why is it that, it seems, automatically, because someone asks a 
question from a different perspective they are presumed to believe that 
perspective?
<br>
<br>While I can believe Jones is of the belief that it is more the 
politician's fault than the journalist's and/or media's fault I can 
allow that he may also see some fault with the media no matter how 
miniscule.
<br>
<br>Is that unreasonable and/or stupid of me?</p>

  <p class="content">D Mick Weir,
<br>I saw the Rosen/Jones interview at the time and commented here too 
on the 25th. I think it is utterly incontrovertible that Jones was in 
total denial that journalists ever do anything wrong, it's all the 
politicians's fault.
<br>
<br>Ad astra quoted this part of Jones' manifold attempt to corral Rosen into saying what Jones wanted him to:
<br>
<br>"(Let me put that to you, though, an alternative theory.) It is not 
coverage that's broken, rather it is the politicians themselves that are
 broken and what's broken in them is their ever-increasing use and 
reliance on spin."
<br> 
<br>DMW You ask, 
<br>"Why is it that, it seems, automatically, because someone asks a 
question from a different perspective they are presumed to believe that 
perspective?" 
<br>
<br>I ask you: What "question"? The only questions here are yours of us, and now mine of you. Jones' words as quoted above are <em>statements</em>,
 he is not asking Rosen's opinion, he is basically arguing unambiguously
 just what he says. That you characterise this as a "question" - seems 
you want us to be victims of Abborttian Spin. 
<br>
<br>Funny the different ways the MSM journalists find to slither.
<br>Jones says <em>It's not Us journalists it's them politicians.</em>
<br>Crassidy says <em>OOOOhhhh it's not me it's them other rotten journalists.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>And them other rotten journalists reckon their body wastes don't stink at all anyway . . .
<br>
<br>Not one has ever come out and said, <em>I have been disingenuous and
 cowardly and lazy and partisan and sycophantic and trivial, well I'm 
going to lift my reportage from now on in the national interest . . . </em>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>And indeed why would they bother, when wiseheads like you DMW are 
prepared to cut them all the slack they could ever use and then some?
<br>
<br>Finally you ask another question (distinguishable by the ? thing at the end), "Is that unreasonable and/or stupid of me?"
<br>
<br>Well you only gave us 3 choices . . . <img src="political-sword_files/smiley-smile.gif" class="flag" alt="Smile"> </p>

<br>I can't resist passing this one on since it follows on from your 
questions over the recent poll results and also speaks to the current 
headline topic. No coincidence that it is written by one of the few 
journalists in Australia that I trust.
<br>
<br><strong>Fixated on carbon and carnal pleasures</strong> by Rob Burgess
<br>
<br><cite title="Quote">If there were any doubts about the effectiveness
 of Tony Abbott’s near single-issue campaigning against Labor’s carbon 
tax in past months, they have been dispelled by new data on the 
popularity of the Gillard government’s wider policy agenda.   The great 
irony for the government is that if voters are told about the other 
reforms – by a polling company no less – they mostly like what they 
hear. 
<br>
<br>**********************************************************
<br>
<br>At <em>Business Spectator</em> we have a habit of starting our 
analysis of national affairs from a policy perspective – looking at the 
machinery that runs our economy rather than the all-singing-all-dancing 
theatrics that too often distract mainstream political discourse. Our 
writers, both staff and contributors, often disagree with each other but
 try to remain focused on policy, not theatre. That, after all, is what 
will build the Australia of tomorrow.   
<br>So what to make of the fact that our major metropolitan papers and 
TV networks spend so much time on brothels and whether or not the 
opposition leader really wanted to 'sell his arse' to become PM? 
<br>  It's only human of course. Sleaze sells. But a fascination with it
 also ultimately harms the punters who buy the papers, or who lazily 
slump in front of tabloid TV in the evenings.   
<br>However, it's not good enough for the Australia that the business 
community, and many others, would like to build for the next generation.</cite>

<br>Thank you for your thoughtful comment to which TT and NormanK have 
responded comprehensively.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I need not say much more.
<br>
<br>The preamble Tony Jones’ used: <em>”Let me put that to you, though, an alternative theory."</em>
 suggested that Jones was about to propose another plausible explanation
 of the 'broken' state of politics.&nbsp;&nbsp;Had he followed this with
 a question: <em>"Could it be that it is not coverage that's broken, 
rather it is the politicians themselves that are broken and what's 
broken in them is their ever-increasing use and reliance on spin?</em>, 
one could have concluded that it was a genuine attempt to explore with 
Rosen an alternative explanation. To me though, what he said sounded 
more like a statement of his firm belief.&nbsp;&nbsp;This view was 
reinforced by his response to Rosen’s suggestion that the media could 
change: <em>“Change their game in what way? It would be hard to imagine 
us changing our own game here on this program dramatically. We do long 
interviews; we do probing interviews with politicians. Hopefully we see 
through the spin. So what is it that you're suggesting should change?</em>”.&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, that did not sound as if Jones saw room for change.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Moreover, his utterances in other places, and his irritable, 
interrupting on-screen behaviour have led me to the view that he 
believes it is the politicians that have fouled up the process with 
their addiction to spin.&nbsp;&nbsp;But he seems not to have gone the 
next step and asked: <em>“Why are they spinning?”</em>

  <p class="content">lyn,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's my humble opinion that Andrew Bolt 
has&nbsp;&nbsp;received a quiet word in his shell-like, and I'd imagine a
 few from News Ltd, like the Editor and Glenn Milne too, from the 
Commonwealth DPP, that it's one thing to go after a backbencher with 
fangs bared, but something altogether more risky, shall we say, to 
attempt to slander the Prime Minister of this country with a matter that
 has already been before the courts once and in a newspaper opinion 
piece once before by the same author, and resulted in a legally-binding 
outcome which stated categorically that the Prime Minister was the 
love-struck dupe for a very sleazy con man.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, we must also reflect back to the time when, now, 
who was it again in the Howard government who took a very public 
Defamation case to court and won significant damages against Random 
House? Oh, that's right, these two men:

<br>
<br>Prominent federal politicians Peter Costello &amp; Tony Abbott 
subsequently sued publisher Random House over Bob Ellis's memoir Goodbye
 Jerusalem, which featured gossip falsely claiming that they had been 
'lured to the Liberal Party' by a sexual liaison. Negotiations about 
damages and an apology were apparently unsuccessful, with the dispute 
proceeding to a judgement by ACT Supreme Court Justice Higgins.
<br>
<br>The Court, reflecting the differentiation between public and private
 lives, awarded the two politicians and their wives some $277,000. The 
publisher pulped copies retrieved from retailers, although many copies 
had been sold by that time and remain accessible through second-hand 
dealers. </cite>
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequent to which the media decided to tread very 
carefully for a while when it came to making baseless assertions about 
prominent Members of Parliament. However, as we have seen recently, with
 the attendant hubris that has come of it's successful campaign to get 
rid of one Prime Minister through veiled assertions about improper 
behaviour and a full court press character assassination, and a 
successful campaign to brainwash the electorate of the suitability for 
high office of a clearly unsuitable man, and that man's own past history
 of doing whatever it takes to achieve his political goals, we therefore
 see that reticence within our media to defame and slander had 
evaporated with the Editor's decision to publish the Glenn Milne smear 
of the Prime Minister.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; No doubt, Milne, Bolt, Mitchell, Murdoch(at a remove), 
and Abbott the master of political skullduggery, thought that they had 
timed to perfection their final blow to the political carcass of the 
Prime Minister, who they no doubt believed was twisting in the wind 
after the Thomson beat-up, and that it was about time to deliver the 
coup de grace to her Prime Ministership. And obviously, this Liberal 
mouthpiece and ex-policeman, Mike Smith, on 2UE, thought that he could 
again deliver a knock-out blow to the Labor Party, after his pivotal 
role in getting Craig Thomson to allegedly implicate himself in the 
Credit Card matter, as it seems that every Union crank with an axe to 
grind and a chip on their shoulder, is now being groomed by the Liberal 
Party apparatchiks once-removed, like Smith(and don't try and tell me he
 doesn't have links to them, if not directly, then indirectly by having a
 hotline to the party), to spew their guts and bile onto Statutory 
Declarations, which are then used to bludgeon the Labor Party with in 
public as they move to enact significant legislation which will cramp 
the style most definitely of these people(and the mooted Federal ICAC 
body is a very big factor here), and also the previously unfttered 
ability for the people who pay these Yellow Journalism pamphleteers and 
megaphones like Milne and Jones/Hadley/Smith &amp; Oldfield, to push 
their barrows for them and get 'the mob' onside with them, against their
 best interests. Which amounts basically to the 
Club/Gambling/Alcohol/Tobacco and Workplace Industries(and don't tell me
 that the oily presence and re-emergence of Peter Reith to put oxygen 
into the embers of the 'Workplace Flexibility' issue isn't a planned 
attack on another front for the government to deal with, now that it 
seems that the Industrial Manpower cabal has formulated the form of 
words to attack the Fair Work Act and the changes it brought about to 
workplace conditions).
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; No, I am 100% convinced that all these forces are 
working hand-in-glove to stop the valid and worthwhile initiatives that 
this greatest government in 20 years is battling to implement. And Tony 
Abbott sold his arse and soul to them years ago. As have drunken 
twerps(and I mean that in the strict dictionary definition sense of the 
word), like Glenn Milne. As for Andrew Bolt, well the word misogyny was 
invented for a goodly number of Dutch males like him.</p>

  <p class="content">MY QUESTIONS OF THE DAY
<br>
<br>Taking into account the latest tricky dick attempt to character 
assassinate yet another Australian Prime Minister by opinion-makers 
&amp; columnists from News Ltd., should the government bring on a media 
inquiry?
<br>
<br>Is it possible that any news organisations in Australia have 
influence over state &amp; federal police?...and do you think any have 
infiltrated the police the way News of the World did in the UK?
<br>
<br>Why did some in News Ltd attack the previous two Victorian police commissioners so intensely by way of their papers?
<br>
<br>Why do SKY NEWS &amp; the Daily Telegraph keep farting on about the 
Thomson affair &amp; why are they trying to tar all unions with the same
 brush? 
<br>
<br>Did Rupert Murdoch's SUN support the Thatcher government's attacks on the National Union of Mineworkers in 1984-85?
<br>
<br>Can you think of any opportunists in our media landscape?&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Is it possible for Tony Abbott to wear a FREE TRADE LIVES 
<br>t-shirt with accompanying GO PROTECTIONISM hardhat without looking 
like he's selling his arse...and/or acting like a weathervane?

<br>I found your thoughtful comment about the Essential Report posted at
 8.46 am (I get an email for each comment), so to save you re-writing it
 I’m posting it for you. 
<br>
<br>“<em>AA, hi. Your figures from the Essential Poll ratify the facts 
of the same schizophrenia I've observed with regard to voters. So much 
support for government policy, so little for the government. It's like 
rationality kicks in when asked to assess achievements; then 
Abbott/Murdoch/Jones et al poison rises when considering the government 
as the people who are driving those achievements. A disconnect driven by
 spite and spitting fury from the megaphone haters with big mouths and 
shriveled hearts. It's a schizophrenia that I fear will see this 
government voted out, and then a dazed electorate will watch as the 
achievements and innovations are watered down or ripped straight out of 
Australians' everyday lives. Then, then, as the Coalition's do-nothing 
approach (AKA, 'the Market knows best') begins and unstoppingly 
continues to drag this nation's citizens (apart from the very wealthy, 
well, duhh), into wage slavery and infrastructure failure, at that time 
government and governing will merge once again. To the destruction of a 
country not only Down Under, but Left Behind.”</em>

  <p class="content">Nasking,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that the answer to one of your questions:
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <cite title="Quote">Is it possible that any

<br>
<br>...can be found in my assessment of the 2UE broadcaster, Mike 
Smith's, role in the Craig Thomson affair. That is, it seems that, in 
this country and probably in others, that the police have gone the other
 way, from the Police Force, and into broadcasting and politics, from 
which vantage point they can influence the public debate in ways that 
suit their agenda. That this agenda is confluent with that of the 'Soft'
 Police State Conservatives, is no surprise really. All they both seem 
to want is a compliant and complicit proletariat workforce, that lives 
and works increasingly-hard for increasingly-less value for their toil, 
and is mollified by Circus Sideshows, such as Sport and the theatrical 
side of politics, as opposed to dour policy workmanship, even though, as
 the Essential poll lays bare, they really actually like the 
manifestations of all that boring policy stuff.</p>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as an Inquiry into media Convergence,

that Senator Conroy might be wise to wait for the Victorian spotfires in

<br>I can't see NormanK's response which I have been waiting for. Has it
 disappeared? Unless you are refering to NK's comments previous to this 
post.
<br>
<br>I am not particularly fond of Jones' style. There are times I find 
his style beyond irritating. It is possibly why I tend to read the 
transcripts rather than watch/listen.
<br>
<br>Going back to the transcript and that offending statement. Two questions/statements earlier Jones said <em>What if I said that political coverage is not broken, not the coverage at least ...</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not quite how you suggested he could have said it but similar. Jones then came back to the offending proposition.
<br>
<br>I agree that the statement/question about what could change showed 
some arrogance and a defensiveness of his programme. The public Jones 
not giving ground.
<br>
<br>Here I think is a bigger part of the problem <em>'not giving ground'</em>
<br>
<br>It is being played as a war and the first to blink is beaten. There 
is no room for difference. Everything seems to be either black or white,
 I am either on the right side and must see it the way the right side 
sees it or I am an enemy.
<br>
<br>We, the observers, appear to have bought into the war and have chosen sides. The media has become the mortal enemy.
<br>
<br>Having reasonable and reasoned discussions on this and many other 
topics becomes increasingly difficult the more we buy into the war 
between the media and politicians.
<br>
<br>There are no winners in wars.
<br>
<br>Last night on QandA Don Watson made some observations that lead me 
toward a view that politicians could also do quite a bit to 'change the 
game' and assist in leading us out of the media morass we are in. I will
 find time to watch again to gain a diffeently informed view.</p>

  <p class="content">While watching the 4C expose on News corp last 
night I was contemplating, how can people behave like that &amp; still 
sleep at night?&nbsp;&nbsp;Not sure I have the answer, they obviously 
have a different moral alignment to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I did think a bit
 about the News or Ruperts model and I think it is fairly 
straightforward. That is:
<br>
<br>1) Produce loud, trashy, opinionated content with large dollops of sex, gossip, private lives of rich &amp; famous stuff
<br>
<br>2) Watch circulation go up as the masses love this crap.
<br>
<br>3) Use, nay flaunt influence this brings to intimidate politicians and opponents. 
<br>
<br>4) Create feedback loop by using influence to increase market share by favorable regulatory decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to 1) 
<br>
<br>The apparatchiks who successfully prosecute this plan are richly 
rewarded and become very loyal as a result.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruperts reward is
 more the power and influence this brings.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the this I
 think he would very quickly waste away, money is no longer 
important.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>The interesting times we are going though now is that the model has 
cracked.&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwindling circulation of daily papers has meant 
increasingly desperate attempts to keep the old system 
going.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fox cable news in USA is probably the only initiative 
that has breathed life into it.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is becoming clear the 
Fox News model&nbsp;&nbsp;is not going to get off the ground (Step 4 
jammed)in either UK or Australia.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed it could fall over 
in the USA if the dirty laundry now coming out implicates his US 
business. 
<br>
<br>James looks like he is a shot duck, so the succession plan is now 
chip wrapper.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a passion for purchasing influence will
 the model survive?&nbsp;&nbsp;An outsider who ran the business with a 
focus on ROI and actually looked after shareholders other than the 
Murdoch family could not keep this up.&nbsp;&nbsp;Particularly if they 
had any ethics in their DNA.
<br>
<br>Past eighty now surely Rupert can not hold on for much longer.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>My fear is that Rupert will finally reveal himself as Davros and there will be no Doctor to save us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<br>
<br>It seems a few of this morning's posts may have gone to Comment Heaven.
<br>My suggestion was that if you have the time, watch the interview 
because transcripts quite often don't convey the full story. I find that
 this is particularly true with Uhlmann/Abbott interviews. On paper 
Uhlmann seems to have asked the hard questions but when you see the limp
 way in which they are delivered and note the lack of interjection and 
belligerence that typifies many of his other interviews it tells a 
different story. Note, I am not necessarily saying here that Uhlmann is 
biased - just different.
<br>
<br>I have no doubt in my mind that Jones was being defensive of the 
Australian media and attempted to portray Rosen's criticisms as being 
only applicable to the U.S. situation. This is more than adequately 
exemplified by his "what changes could we make" remark.
<br>
<br>I'm a bit non-plussed by your comments @ 1.15 PM. If you feel as 
though you are under fire, perhaps it is because some here believe that 
the media in Australia is very, very unwell but I can't recall anyone 
attesting that it is a one-way street. In fact, that is the biggest bone
 I have to pick with mainstream commentators - the unwillingness of 
journalists to acknowledge that they are in a symbiotic relationship 
with politicians and that therefore when they criticise the body politic
 for being boring or manufactured or overly managed, they are (or should
 be) criticising themselves as well. The media and politicians are 
engaged in a dance that goes back 150 years or more. If politicians and 
their minders find new ways to manipulate the media then they find new 
ways to counter it - most typically by pointing to the manipulation and 
crying "look at that!" If the media finds new ways to wedge politicians 
then they come up with new ways to circumvent that occurring - press 
releases late on a Friday being a good example. Like any high risk 
dancing, the two performers are relying on each other for support. If 
one suddenly stops then it is likely that both will fall over.
<br>
<br>I didn't see the Don Watson interview but will endeavour to do so 
this afternoon. It is encouraging to think that there may be ways for 
politicians to play a leading role in nursing our political media back 
to health but I am not optimistic when the patient doesn't believe that 
they are ill.
<br>
<br>If my comment from this morning resurfaces, you will find that I did
 give a bit of ground. I can see where you are coming from with regard 
to projecting our own inferences onto Jones but I reckon if you watch 
the video you may have a slight change of heart. As I have said 
previously, Jones is not alone in this. Look at how many journalists 
came out in attack mode over Tanner's book and yet he was the first to 
attest that politicians and their minders have to shoulder their share 
of the blame for the poor state of affairs. So too must the audience - 
if we didn't give tabloid television and gossip-ridden newspapers the 
support that they currently enjoy through ratings and sales, that style 
would fade away.
<br>
<br>The only reporter that I have seen acknowledge that there may be a 
problem in Australia is Annabelle Crabb who has sworn to fight her 
addiction to opinion polls. Apart from her, our journalists seem to 
believe they are being objective and (worse still) that they exist 
outside of the political arena and are merely well-informed spectators. 
Nothing could be further from the truth.

  <p class="content">&nbsp;&nbsp; From yesterday's Crikey:
<br>
<br>***
<br>
<br>Milne debacle: how a 16 year old story was spiked by The Oz
<br>by Senior Journalist Andrew Crook
<br>
<br>Glenn Milne has egg all over his face after the re-hired columnist 
filed an error-filled op-ed reviving discredited allegations that Prime 
Minister Julia Gillard had somehow been an accomplice to her one-time 
partner Bruce Wilson's alleged fraud.
<br>
<br>The piece rehashed 16-year-old claims -- vociferously denied by the 
Prime Minister whenever they are dredged up -- suggesting Gillard had 
lived in a house with Wilson bought using illegal cash.
<br>
<br>Milne had previously written about the saga in 2007. But this 
morning the Walkleys brawler went further, stating that "Gillard shared a
 home in Fitzroy bought by Wilson using the embezzled funds."
<br>
<br>Crikey understands that this sentence, removed by News Limited lawyers four years ago, is false.
<br>
<br>Now, the entire piece has been deleted from The Australian's 
website, with the newspaper forced to issue a grovelling apology 
acknowledging that the "assertions are untrue". Damningly, Milne had 
failed to ring the PM's office for comment.
<br>
<br>The Australian's editor, Clive Mathieson, issued the following 
statement to Crikey this morning: "We’re investigating the Prime 
Minister’s claim of inaccuracies in the story. As the correction points 
out, we regret that the PM was not given any chance to respond to the 
allegations."
<br>
<br>Asked whether Milne would be sacked, Mathieson said "he remains a contributor to The Australian."
<br>
<br>But while the article has been removed, the line continues to fester
 on fellow News Limited columnist Andrew Bolt's blog. Interestingly, 
Bolt has written the following disclaimer directly after it:
<br>
<br>"I am not sure that Gillard did share a home with Wilson. My own understanding is that she maintained her own house."
<br>
<br>Late this morning, the Ten Network talk show host issued an "update", acknowledging The Oz had pulled the story.
<br>
<br>While a popular topic in the right wing blogosphere, the allegations are rarely taken seriously by professional journalists.
<br>
<br>The fresh outbreak was three days in the making. Bolt had first 
blogged about the saga on Saturday, publishing part of a statutory 
declaration by embittered ex- Australian Workers Union Victorian vice 
president Bob Kernohan that was quoted by Milne. "It could be the last 
straw for Gillard's leadership," Bolt hypothesised.
<br>
<br>The yarn had gathered steam a day earlier when 2UE afternoons jock 
Michael Smith said on air that he had been contacted by "a number of 
listeners" who had dredged up the Kernohan claims -- first aired under 
privilege by Phil Gude in the Victorian parliament in 1995 and then 
again in 2001 by Liberal MP turned lobbyist Geoff Leigh.
<br>
<br>Leigh told parliament that former AWU state secretary (and future 
jet-setting MP) Bob Smith had told Kernohan that Wilson had "spent 
$17,000 of women's clothing for Gillian (sic) Gillard out of union 
funds" while Gillard was John Brumby's chief-of-staff.
<br>
<br>Kernohan's story goes that during her time as a partner at Slater 
&amp; Gordon, Gillard set up the association Wilson used as WA state 
secretary to allegedly funnel cash from employers. In a new statutory 
declaration made last year, he says two houses -- one owned by Wilson in
 Fitzroy and another by the PM -- had been bought or renovated using 
dirty funds.
<br>
<br>Despite the usual legal disclaimers, 2UE's Smith lapped it up to 
opine that "much of this comes to the heart of the judgement of the lady
 who runs the country."
<br>
<br>The factional motivation for the leaks has gone mostly unnoticed.
<br>
<br>Bob Kernohan was in office when elements of the left took control of
 the old Victorian AWU in 1989. He has been at war with his internal AWU
 enemies ever since, alleging financial fraud in 1992 and in 1995 lobbed
 a kamikaze bid to unseat Bill Ludwig as the union's national president.
<br>
<br>Bruce Wilson was an ally of Ludwig and former national secretary Ian
 Cambridge, but was dumped&nbsp;&nbsp;after the financial irregularities
 emerged. National Crime Authority and fraud squad investigations were 
initiated but there were never any adverse findings and Wilson never 
returned any money. On 2UE this afternoon, Kernohan said he was offered a
 seat in parliament -- presumably by forces loyal to Ludwig -- if he 
stayed silent.
<br>
<br>The weak Gillard link has been doing the rounds among the PM's 
enemies for years. In 2006, Kim Beazley supporters revived them when 
they thought she was hatching a deal to knife him as opposition leader.
<br>
<br>And in 2007, The Age's Jason Koutsoukis wrote that he had been 
summoned to a meeting with a figure who had presented him with a 
disappointing file that included a "well-worn tirade aired in the 
Victorian parliament last century."
<br>
<br>It's worth quoting these lines:
<br>
<br>"The one skeleton in Gillard's closet is the allegation — first 
raised under parliamentary privilege in 1995 by former Kennett minister 
Phil Gude — that Gillard's one-time partner Bruce Wilson, a former 
secretary of the Australian Workers' Union, was under investigation by 
the National Crime Authority and Victoria Police over the 
misappropriation of union funds.
<br>
<br>"According to Gude, the union funds were used to renovate Gillard's house and buy her some personal items.
<br>
<br>"Gillard has repeatedly dismissed the allegations as being totally untrue and those who repeat them as 'lying cowards'.
<br>
<br>On Friday, 2UE's Smith said one of the reasons for the rehash was 
that Gillard had said (to Milne in 2007) that she was "young and naive".
 In fact, the PM has consistently shot down the suggestions with supreme
 force each time they get trotted out.
<br>
<br>On Australian Story in 2006, she stated point blank that the 
suggestions were "absolutely untrue ... of course I was angry and 
anybody whose subject to those sort of allegations under the privilege 
of Parliament, you are going to be angry and you don't get a fair go in 
responding ... so once the allegations are out there they are going to

them to think that there's something in them, so I was yeah you know

denials and move on."

<br>There were a number of other factual howlers in Milne's article. He 
referred to the Health Services Union as the "Hospital Services Union", 
made a hash of the HSU's Victorian factional dynamic (Jeff and Kathy 
Jackson were hardly friendly with Craig Thomson) and got hopelessly 
confused over the separation between the national office and the HSU's 
former No. 1 Victorian branch.

<br>On 2UE early this afternoon, the key portions of a promised 
pre-recorded interview with Kernohan failed to proceed on legal grounds.
 Hilariously, Michael Smith said that his talent had been moved to a 
"safe location".</p>

<br><strong>Gillard calls; Murdoch paper sorry</strong> by Tony Wright
<br>
<br><cite title="Quote">THE alarm bells had been ringing in Julia 
Gillard's office for days, but they really went shrill after the first 
of the Prime Minister's media staff arrived yesterday, as they do daily,
 at 4.30am.
<br>
<br>****************************************
<br>
<br>This was one for the Prime Minister's personal attention, her staff 
decided. Ms Gillard made a furious early morning phone call to John 
Hartigan, the chief executive of News Ltd, which publishes The 
Australian.
<br>
<br>Another call went to The Australian's editor Chris Mitchell. Both 
calls demanded an immediate retraction and apology amid threats of legal
 action.
<br>
<br>Shortly after 9.30am, Milne's column disappeared from The 
Australian's website and was replaced by a short and sharp apology, 
headlined ''Correction''.</cite>

  <p class="content">NormanK,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up until now I had 
decided to stay out of the Jones/Rosen debate, believing that ultimately
 the truth would out about the affront Jones manifested wrt Rosen's 
comments. I thought that DMW would see the reasoning behind your 
explanation and eventually concur. because there waas no other way to 
read Jones' reaction. Unlike DMW, I like to read an interview by the 
visuals and leave the words to a secondary role in proceedings, although
 this conversation between two journalists did have a lot of word play 
that was interesting to listen to and sub-contextualise. However, it was
 the optics of the interview that hit the point home about Tony Jones' 
sanctimonious and priggish response to Rosen's statement about the way 
journalists behave, that said it all to me. Jones was obviously alive to
 the import of Jay Rosen's words, and you could see Jones' eyes 
immediately narrow and his butt clench as he bridled at Rosen's 
implicated assertion, which Jones took personally and which Rosen meant 
to be a personal observation I am sure.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen it too often on Q&amp;A as well wrt Jones 
always looking after the image that he projects to his audience, and if 
anyone on the panel ever takes a sly dig at him he peremptorily 
interrupts and bumptiously defends himself. To say his skin is thin, is 
not to put too fine a point on it. Hence he appears to be totally 
unwilling and unable to admit any sort of journalistic character flaw. 
Which, while he is so concerned about defending his journalistic legacy,
 he is at one and the same time demeaning and trivialising it because he
 will not take on board constructive criticism, and so, therefore, 
enhance his ability, which would then be realised by the sentient 
amongst his audience.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Not that Tony Jones would ever take my advice, he's a Senior ABC journalist after all. <img src="political-sword_files/smiley-wink.gif" class="flag" alt="Wink"></p>

  <p class="content">D Mick Weir
<br>Thank you for your further comment.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had 
‘disappearing comments’ this morning, so here is what NormanK had to say
 about the Tony Jones interview of Jay Rosen: “<em>D Mick Weir - If you 
can spare the time, watch the video. I am under no illusions about where
 Tony Jones stood during that interview. The other relevant quote (in 
part): Jones: It would be hard to imagine us changing our own game here 
on this program dramatically. I can see the point that you are trying to
 make but you might reach a different conclusion if you watch the vision
 rather than relying on the transcript, which we know can be deceptive. I
 say that because on occasion I have thought to deconstruct a 
Uhlmann/Abbott interview using the transcript and unfortunately on paper
 they usually appear more balanced than on the video. <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2011/s3302557.htm" rel="nofollow">www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2011/s3302557.htm</a> “</em>
<br>
<br>You are right though to point out that the combatants do not want to
 give way in what has become a war of words.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tony Jones does 
not want to give way, nor do most fellow journalists (Laura Tingle 
excepted), to the Lindsay Tanner notion that the behaviour of the media 
has conditioned most politicians to behave the way they do – defensive, 
spin-laden, non-committal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet Tanner never said that 
politicians were blameless.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the old chicken and egg 
argument, which is now irrelevant as we are clearly in a mess and need 
to find a way out.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s somewhat like marital discord where 
each party blames the other, and where resolution is not possible until 
both give ground and acknowledge faults on both side.
<br>
<br>Jay Rosen believes that the media holds the whip handle in that it 
is the side best placed to make a change towards a more productive 
interaction with politicians, which he says it could do if it so 
chose.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that politicians are unlikely to 
change and become the open, honest-to-God, tell-it-the-way-it-is real 
people, for which Don Watson yearns, until they see some willingness in 
the media to compromise.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the media made even a modest 
gesture towards rapprochement, which I had hoped may have occurred when 
Julia Gillard met with John Hartigan and his News Limited editors, it 
could bring about a more open and efficient process of communication 
with the public via collaborative journalists.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, as we 
have seen in the last twenty-four hours News Limited is still gunning 
for PM Gillard in a most despicable way.&nbsp;&nbsp;What encouragement 
towards openness does that invite?&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite – battening 
down the hatches, is a more likely response.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>In this war, which your rightly indentify as such, if face-to-face 
negotiation cannot achieve rapprochement, the only move I can see that 
might work, is for the media, through its various outlets, beginning to 
give PM Gillard and her ministers a fair go, and refrain from laying 
traps for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;As trust built, I could envisage politicians 
opening up and becoming more real, more genuine, more willing to state 
it the way it is.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it would take only one betrayal by the 
media to set the relationship back to its lamentable contemporary 
state.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflect on who in the media might be amenable to 
changing behaviour – Andrew Bolt?&nbsp;&nbsp;Glenn Milne? Piers Akerman?
 Miranda Devine? Alan Jones? Ray Hadley? Not likely.&nbsp;&nbsp;But less
 radical ones might – Chris Uhlmann, Leigh Sales, Tony Jones, Ali Moore,
 Sabra Lane, even Neil Mitchell.
<br>
<br>Regarding Don Watson, I enjoyed his <em>Recollections of a Bleeding Heart: A Portrait of Paul Keating. PM</em>
 and his later but smaller books.&nbsp;&nbsp;His hobbyhorse is the words
 that public speakers, particularly politicians, use.&nbsp;&nbsp;I 
suspect he coined the term ‘weasel words’.&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was 
unsurprising to hear him hold forth, somewhat incomprehensively, on this
 last night on <em>Q&amp;A</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The transcript is not yet available but I’ll post it when it is.
<br>
<br>So, DMW, as both sides share responsibility for the current state of
 affairs, who will make the first move towards peace between the media 
and the politicians?&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion it needs to be people in 
the media.&nbsp;&nbsp;But how likely is that?

<br>
<br>Feral,
<br>you put it brilliantly.
<br>
<br>And notice who primarily benefits from the sports &amp; "theatrical 
side of politics"...none other than the Murdoch empire by way of Fox 
Sports, Foxtel (partial owners) and the tabloids etc. 
<br>
<br>Murdoch has been playin' this game w/ the people for a good long 
time and it's about bloody time they woke up to it. It's manipulation 
&amp; setting agendas by way of too much bloody cross-media 
ownership...and too much influence w/ other authority figures. 
<br>
<br>The rest of the media needs to work a darn site harder...if they had, Murdoch would not have the power he has. 
<br>
<br><cite title="Quote">well, I think it might be safe to say that 
Senator Conroy might be wise to wait for the Victorian spotfires in the

<br>Feral,
<br>there's been far too much waiting...and it's put our politics &amp; 
media &amp; aspects of society onto a merry-go-round of the 
damned...damned if ya do...damned if ya don't. Anything will be attacked
 and transformed into sh*te by that lot...as long as it grabs them 
attention and brings in the moolah...and/or pleases the gatekeepers and 
their boss.
<br>
<br>It makes for an overly-cynical society...suspicious of everything 
&amp; anything. The Q&amp;A audience &amp; panel last nite was a good, 
sad example of such.
<br>
<br>This media Moriarity has spread a vile, insidious disease for 4 
decades that has penetrated every organ and artery of our country...and 
much of the world his empire has touched. 
<br>
<br>It's time to deal w/ it once &amp; for all...waiting will only see 
more waves of sickness...the attacks on the PM will not stop...nor will 
it end w/ Abbott...or Turnbull...or Smith...or Combet...each chosen one 
is eventually sacrificed for the commercial imperative...and to fit the 
goals of the mastermind himself...if not him, the minions he has set 
loose on this planet to complete his ugly, vicious, myth &amp; 
fear-driven plans.
<br>
<br><cite title="Quote">Though, as you say, the media's attitude towards
 the government can't get much worse, so they should probably just 'Damn
 the Torpedoes!'.</cite>
<br>
<br>Indeed. How many good, useful people must fall before that dam is busted? 
<br>
<br>Good to see so many courageous in the UK...reclaiming their land &amp; dignity...attempting to cure the disease.

  <p class="content">Crikey today:
<br>
<br><cite title="Quote">Dear Sole Subscriber,
<br>
<br>The future of Australian quality journalism took a big hit last week, not that anyone seemed to notice.
<br>
<br>Buried deep within the annual results released by Fairfax Media on 
Friday was the astonishing news that three of this country's four 
quality newspapers are now barely profitable. (The fourth, The 
Australian, owned by rival News Limited, is almost certainly 
unprofitable and is run for non-commercial reasons).
<br>The figures submerged in the Fairfax accounts reveal that in the 
first six months of this year the profitability of The Sydney Morning 
Herald, The Age and The Australian Financial Review collapsed. Our best 
estimate of those numbers is that in that period the print editions of 
The Age and SMH between them are now in loss -- compared to a comparable
 figure of about $60 million-$80 million just a few years ago. The 
Financial Review appears to be down to about $5 million-$10 million for 
the period, half its profit of a few years ago.
<br>
<br>While Fairfax is hoping this capitulation is the result of cyclical 
pressures, anyone who watches trends in media knows that most of the 
collapse is structural and it will continue.
<br>What we are now watching is a slow-motion train wreck of the quality
 fourth estate. Unless someone steps in -- and the only logical someone 
is government -- we could be within sight of the demise of half of 
Australia's serious print journalism, The SMH and The Age.
<br>
<br>The case for a full-scale government inquiry into the Australian 
media is compelling. Not an inquiry to denigrate News Corp, but one that
 confronts the reality of a market failure that is killing the viability
 of the most important newspapers in our democracy.</cite>
<br>
<br>Quality journalism about important subjects would send sales up 
again. Seems like a no-brainer to me but not to the owners and editors.
<br>
<br>They who live by the gutter shall die by the gutter.

<br>Thanks for another great piece. We have a crisis on our hands here

the inability of our politicians to adapt to it or to counter it where 
possible.

<br>One other aspect of the steady evolution (devolution?) of political 
journalism was highlighted during the Jones/Rosen interview. That is the
 blurring of the line between being an interviewer and being a 
commentator. We canvassed this subject earlier in the year when 
discussing Ali Moore's post-budget round-table discussion where she 
wanted to be a player. This exchange between Jones and Rosen are what I 
am referring to:
<br><cite title="Quote">TONY JONES: <strong>I'm</strong> wondering if 
you're (sic) perspective is peculiarly US-centric; in other words, it 
doesn't take into account the differences when there's an independent 
public broadcaster as there is here in Australia or in Canada or in the 
UK, for example.
<br>
<br>JAY ROSEN: Well, the strength of the ABC is certainly an advantage 
Australia has over the US, but you tell me, Tony, do you not see any of 
these things happening in the Australian political system? 
<br>
<br>TONY JONES: We could do this by you asking me the questions, but it is probably better to do it the other way around.</cite>
<br>
<br>Bear in mind that this came after comments such as this from Jones:
<br>
<br><cite title="Quote">TONY JONES: Take it back to a golden age of 
political coverage, if such a thing ever existed. What was it like when 
it was better? <strong>I</strong> can't really remember a time when it was much better than this?</cite>
<br>
<br>Jones has drawn himself into the discussion so that it now has the 
appearance of being a conversation between peers but as soon as Rosen 
behaves conversationally i.e. asks a question, Jones cuts him dead. This
 is one of the shortcomings of contemporary interviewing techniques and 
presentation - the insertion of contentions, premises and opinion into 
questions and commentary.
<br>
<br>Imagine, if you will, an exchange between myself and a sibling.
<br>I ask: "Given that it is most likely going to rain tomorrow, do you think it is wise to plan a fishing trip?"
<br>If this were a conversation, the response would very likely be: 
<br>"What makes you think it's going to rain? The weather man says clear skies and no wind tomorrow."
<br>I might respond: "Nanna's bones are aching and you know she is very rarely wrong about these things."
<br>The conversation is likely to proceed down these lines where my 
contention becomes the focal point and the viability of a fishing trip 
ultimately hangs on its credibility.
<br>If this were an interview where the respondent is unable (by convention) to ask a question, the response is likely to be:
<br>"I don't agree with the contention in the first part of your 
question. I am relying on experts for the forecast and they say it will 
be fine".
<br>
<br>How often have we heard 'I don't agree with the contention/premise 
in your question' from our politicians - in particular, of late, from 
the PM but it is certainly not exclusive to one side of politics. As a 
result the politician looks recalcitrant or retreats into obfuscation or
 diverts the question around to grab hold of a talking point in order to
 not appear reluctant to answer questions.
<br>
<br>Yes, this is an example of a loaded question but it goes further 
than that - the interviewer wants to show that they are a player, that 
they know what's going on but they never place themselves in a position 
where they have to defend their opinions/contentions. This is just one 
example of how contemporary political journalism paints politicians into
 a corner from which they can't escape. Occasionally, one of them will 
get frustrated and fire a question back at the interviewer but then of 
course this is portrayed as them losing their cool under heavy 
interrogation.
<br>
<br>Jones could have worded the question above as: "Is your perspective 
peculiarly US-centric .........?" but then he wouldn't have been a 
player.
<br>Similarly he could have simply left out "I can't really remember a 
time when it was much better than this?" My response to that was: "Who 
bloody cares what you think Tony?"
<br>
<br>This blurring of the line between interviewer and commentator is taken to its extreme in programmes like <em>Insiders</em>
 where there is no demarcation and it becomes a free-for-all where 
unsubstantiated opinion abounds and there is no effective moderator to 
question the veracity of some of the claims that are made. Ultimately, 
that's just gossip.
<br>
<br>Something journalists could do to raise the standard of political 
debate is to disengage themselves from the game and actually be the 
disinterested observer that they so often claim to be.</p>

  <p class="content">Nasking,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But didn't that God-fearin' State, Virginia, cop the full brunt of the storm? <img src="political-sword_files/smiley-laughing.gif" class="flag" alt="Laughing">
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I noticed the other day that Michelle Bachmann was
 one of the first fulsome supporters of that vile, anti-female 
empowerment movement, 'Quiverfull'. Hence the "I have had 5 children and
 fostered 23 more". Groan. Not adding, of course, that the reason she 
did it was not out of pure altruism towards the kids but to indoctrinate
 them with her particular brand of Right Wing Religious Extremism. Bet 
they were all 'Home Schooled', which, of course, is just the 
mealy-mouthed euphemism of the Religious Right for their own 21st 
century brand of segregation of children from the wider community, who 
may, shock! horror! expose their tiny minds to those evil thoughts of 
'Religious Tolerance', or 'Multiculturalism", or, the mmost evil of all 
in the Bachmann's eyes, 'Atheism'. <img src="political-sword_files/smiley-smile.gif" class="flag" alt="Smile">
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, as with the Palins, the Bachmann pater 
familia realised early on that he was best advised to be the brains 
behind the operation because he was essentially unelectable. I mean, 
have you heard him speak and seen him dance with Michelle? So, out of 
the 'Respect', or, actually the 'Obedience' that the religion which 
Michelle follows demands of her, she does what he tells her to and 
functions as the spigot through which he pours his political 
aspirations. Yes, she wouldn't mind being President, just like many 
before her haven't minded the idea of being President of the PTA, but 
every decision she would make would be run by the 'Head of the Family' 
first. </p>

  <p class="content">&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Andrew Bolt's column tomorrow, I
 fully expect that he has spent the day crafting an apologia which will 
reaffirm the essence of his conclusion from Saturday that, 'the PM lacks
 judgement', plus some sort of mealy-mouthed faint praise meant to give 
the impression of a concession to the PM, merely to mollify but not to 
show any contrition. Then it will be back to 'Business As Usual' from 
the day after that.</p>

<br>Good stuff, what a bunch they are. I remember (on a show whose name I
 forget) a then fairly junior minister Tony Abbott delivering a 
heartfelt lament about the increasing lack of tolerance &amp; growing 
litigiousness in this country &amp; wishing we could all be a bit nicer 
to our fellows. Another participant (Mungo McCallum) gave a contemptuous
 snort &amp; demanded "How much did you get out of Bob Ellis?" Abbott 
put on his finest shit-eating grin &amp; as I recall sat mute for some 
time.
<br>More seriously, this latest affair stinks to high heaven &amp; definitely appears to be a coordinated final blow.
<br>All the withdrawals &amp; apologies will count for nought as the 
story's out there &amp; media legal departments will effortlessly work 
out ways to keep it alive if they think there's mileage in it.</p>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought you might be interested in this Health angle about the new Victorian Government(from today's Crikey):
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <cite title="Quote">Unhealthy 
appointments in Victoria. Health insiders in Victoria are bemused at 
some of the senior board appointments the new Liberal minister David 
Davis is making. Apart from the now traditional knocking off of previous
 government appointees, however qualified and competent, and replacement
 by political mates, our tipster claims the less-than-stellar form of 
some of the new appointees has been ignored: "Two recent appointments 
are head honchos who were sacked by the hospitals they previously served
 while another, more worryingly, rorted the hospital system to the tune 
of $1 million by being paid out for accumulated, untaken sick leave. In 
the latter instance, the gent even persuaded hard-headed businesspeople 
on his board that this was standard CEO contract practice (it may be in 
the private sector but certainly wasn't in health)."</cite></p>

<br>What an insightful contribution you have made at 4.14.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for your comments.
<br>
<br>You put your finger on an important point – to what extent do 
journalists, particularly those on radio or TV, want to be part of the 
discussion as against being simply interrogators seeking information and
 answers from politicians. The examples you give are apt.
<br>
<br>It seems to me that Tony Jones and Ali Moore want to be 
participants, and to a lesser extent Leigh Sales and Chris 
Uhlmann.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course Alan Jones wants more than that – he wants
 to be the lead player who calls the shots, and if you disagree with 
him, watch out for his acid, bullying tongue. 
<br>
<br>How do we know which role they intend to play?&nbsp;&nbsp;It would 
make it clearer to the audience if at the outset they gave us a preamble
 such as: “I have a number of important issues to discuss with X as I 
have a great interest in this area.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will pose questions and
 add my opinion as we proceed.”&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the old problem – the 
inextricable mixing of facts and opinion.&nbsp;&nbsp;So often 
journalists mix them, and thereby confuse the audience.&nbsp;&nbsp;News 
Limited journalists no doubt take their cue from Uncle Rupert who 
believes ‘opinion is news’.
<br>
<br>It is perhaps idealistic to believe that journalists might give us a
 clue as to their role in any interview, but we are allowed to dream.

<br>The latest in the Gillard/Hartigan clash is that Hartigan has

thinking that with your knowledge of the Melbourne Medical scene you 
might be able, by a process of deduction and a few phone calls, to 
figure out who they were. It can't be too hard to find out the 
scuttlebutt about failed Hospital Administrators in recent times in 
Victoria. Then marry that info with the names of recent appointments by 
the Baillieu government. Then just keep a Watching Brief over them and 
wait for the shenaningans to inevitably start all over again. Or, you 
could simply get a list of donors to the Liberal Party who are also 
Doctors and friends of Michael Wooldridge. <img src="political-sword_files/smiley-wink.gif" class="flag" alt="Wink"></p>

 Media Convergence(anything else would look like a witchhunt), in this

mild rebuke of The Australian at a Press Conference today, "The Prime 
Minister's remarks were disapponting and pedantic."

  <p class="content">Brilliant article again, AA. I wish I had more time
 to read through the very informative links also provided in the 
comments, but sadly a combination of work and university don't spare 
that sort of time. 
<br>
<br>I think the point was put across nicely by Lindsay Tanner. The truth simply has lower ratings than emotional hyperbole. 
<br>
<br>The truth that Pink Batts and the BER were magnificent 
infrastructure investments that helped keep the economy afloat during 
the GFC will always have lower ratings than some Coalition MP screaming 
that Pink Batts will gain sentience, fly out of your ceiling and eat 
your children. 
<br>
<br>The truth that the Carbon Tax is a very fair and worthy policy 
designed only to reduce pollution and not to harm households (achieving 
this by balancing off consumer losses with massive tax breaks) will 
always have lower ratings than a group of Coalition Senators led by Mary
 Jo Fisher dancing to Michael Jackson's Thriller singing about how 
you'll be fighting for your life from Killer Gillard tonight. 
<br>
<br>And the truth that this government is probably the most effective 
and competent one we've seen in a generation will always have lower 
ratings than the amazing Tumbling Tony who is allowed to say anything he
 likes, even if it is outrageous or completely contradicts something he 
said under a minute prior.
<br>
<br>Going off on a tangent here, that's another thing that I can't stand
 about Abbott, that he's allowed to say anything without evidence. As a 
Bachelor of Science student, I can't write a single paragraph in a 
report without citations. But not even a "How much will that policy 
cost, Tony?" is uttered by the adoring journalists around him that are 
supposed to be the 'arbiters of morality and justice' or something as 
they so pretentiously name themselves. 
<br>
<br>And when Tony ditches them when the questions get a little too hard,
 they happily totter off to paraphrase every bit of rubbish that he said
 in their articles, conveniently leaving out the bits when he couldn't 
stand the slightest inkling of scrutiny. 
<br>
<br>Well, I hope the media are happy that they've bet every shred of 
credibility they have on Abbott's Coalition, because it looks like the 
tides are starting to turn. The Government seems to be winning in this 
whole stoush with the media firing their guns at them over Thompson and 
now the lies they tried to peddle about Julia Gillard. They would hope 
that Australia will forget their blatant campaign to try to get the 
Lunatic Nasty Party onto the government benches, because I certainly 
won't. </p>

  <p class="content">Whilst you are all going on about the tiny little 
issue of Milne and Bolt, whose comments have been retracted and have 
been given a flogging by the PM, more important issues have been 
occurring. Today the ACCC announced that they will not be signing off on
 the NBN deal due to competition concerns among other things, and have 
said that major changes need to be made for the agreement to be able to 
be passed:
<br>
<br>THE competition regulator has raised "serious" concerns about the 
critical agreement between Telstra and the company building the National
 Broadband Network, in a shock blow to the $36 billion project.
<br>
<br>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims has
 indicated that Telstra's plan to structurally separate its retail and 
wholesale arms - a key plank of Labor's NBN policy - faces being knocked
 back and Telstra required to make "important" changes.
<br>
<br>Among issues worrying the ACCC is an agreement that will prevent 
Telstra from actively promoting wireless services as an alternative to 
the NBN network - a measure critics claim is an attempt to stifle 
competition and prop up the NBN business model.
<br>
<br>Telstra submitted its separation undertaking in late July, outlining
 its plan to migrate to the NBN as it gradually ceases to supply 
fixed-line voice and broadband services over its copper and HFC 
networks.
<br>
<br>However in a paper discussing Telstra's undertaking, the ACCC says 
it cannot accept the telco giant's separation plans in their current 
form.
<br>
<br>Its objections could delay reforms essential to the rollout of the NBN.
<br>
<br>“The ACCC's preliminary view is that the particular structural 
separation undertaking that has been provided could not be accepted, and
 hence Telstra will need to resubmit this document in a form that fully 
complies with the legislative requirements,” the watchdog said in a 
statement.
<br>
<br>The ACCC has highlighted concerns about provisions against Telstra 
promoting wireless services as a substitute for NBN Co's fibre services,
 and the limitation on the telco's ability to provide cable internet 
services to customers, as among issues that would prevent its approval 
of the plan.
<br>
<br>The ACCC is also concerned that the $11 billion deal between the NBN
 Co and Telstra for the telco giant to migrate its customers on to the 
new fibre network could potentially be exempt from competition laws 
without undergoing further ACCC scrutiny.
<br>
<br>“The ACCC has serious concerns about arrangements between Telstra 
and NBN CO that include the parties' ability to vary the arrangements 
without further scrutiny by the ACCC,” the regulator said.
<br>
<br>In its discussion paper the ACCC is pressing for more safeguards 
around transparency and equivalent access for competitors in the lead-up
 to the rollout of the National Broadband Network.
<br>
<br>“The ACCC's initial view is that there needs to be a clear and 
enforceable commitment to an 'equivalence of outcomes'&nbsp;&nbsp;that 
enables wholesale customers and Telstra's retail businesses to gain 
access to key input services of equivalent quality and functionality,” 
Mr Sims said.
<br>
<br>Telstra said it had been in “productive” discussions with the ACCC 
for some months and was aware of the issues the commission has raised.
<br>
<br>“Telstra believes these issues can be resolved in a way consistent 
with our principle of protecting shareholder value, and the company will
 continue to work closely with the ACCC to address its concerns,” a 
Telstra spokeswoman said.
<br>
<br>A spokesman for Communications Minister Stephen Conroy told The 
Australian Online the issue was “entirely a matter for the ACCC”.
<br>
<br>“The government welcomes the release of the discussion paper and 
encourages all interested parties to participate in the ACCC's 
consultation process,” the spokesman said.
<br>
<br>“I look forward to the ACCC making a final determination on this matter in due course.”
<br>
<br>UPDATED Annabel Hepworth and Mitchell Bingemann
<br>
<br><a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/australian-it/accc-concerned-at-telstras-agreement-not-to-promote-wireless-as-a-substitute-for-the-nbn/story-e6frgakx-1226125493744" rel="nofollow">www.theaustralian.com.au/.../story-e6frgakx-1226125493744</a>
<br>
<br>If this gets into the media and the deal falls apart the government 
is stuffed. This is the only area in the community's mind, where the 
government actually has something positive going for it. This decision 
today throws another spanner in the works for a government which really 
cannot afford any more self inflicted wounds. What did Gillard say again
 before the 2010 election, "I believe in evidence based policy", well if
 only they had got the evidence and the regulatory backing before they 
started to spend millions of our dollars!</p>

<br>No I won't forget either Von Kirsdarke, in fact I can remember very

<br>
<br>We have bad Abbott saying anything, doing anything, his lies are 
<br>going up and up and up.&nbsp;&nbsp;Funny though today: Abbott has 
spent 12 months walking of in the middle of a press conference, today he
 said "anymore questions"&nbsp;&nbsp; not one journalist had a question.

  <p class="content">Jason,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn't it amusing how the 'Born 
To Rules' suddenly find it within themselves, when convenient only, to 
throw their support behind a couple of 'Union Thugs'?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, we had Droog Number 1, Sir Tony Liealot, 
commending Kathy Jackson for her 'courage' in standing up to the 
government. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, we have Sir Ian SICalot making sure we know just 
what a wonderful human being that Jack Kernohan is, and he is prepared 
to link to the toilet paper smeared with merde that JK calls a Statutory
 Declaration about dealings the PM had with a convicted conman. How 
kind. I imagine though that SICalot washed his hands thoroughly after he
 typed in the link. Wouldn't want to get up too close and personal with 
the doings of the hoi polloi now, even at once remove over the internet.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Junior j woodchuck, fresh from his Tamworth 
National Agrarian Socialist Party meeting, comes loaded with his latest 
batch of talking points, making massive conceptual leaps with a single 
bound of youthful enthusiasm for the cause of poking his tongue out 
metaphorocally at the Gillard government, to impress who here, I wonder?
 Maybe he cuts and pastes his contributions here back to Menzies House 
for their amusement. I don't know, I never go there to find out the 
answer to that question, as I've never been taken with playing virtual 
games of 'Who can make the Menzies House Sao biscuit the soggiest?', 
such as jj seems to delight in, or so it seems to me anyway. <img src="political-sword_files/smiley-wink.gif" class="flag" alt="Wink">
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, contrary to jj's assertion that this 
ACCC/Telstra clash of heads could(he hopes, he hopes) see the NBN fall 
over, instead, what it seems to me is that Telstra and the ACCC have 
been in discussions for months and are amicably working together to 
resolve the issues. One of which appears to relate to equivalence of 
access of wholesaler competitors to the same things Telstra has access 
to. Which, if you were a true Conservative, and not an Agrarian 
Socialist and CINOI, as jj is, you would actually applaud as a means by 
which a level playing field could be created in the wholesale telco 
market. However, silly me, I forgot that Latter Day CINOs, like jj, whom
 I'm sure wears a mean pair of Chinos to reinforce the fact that he is a
 Conservative In Name Only, well, they're actually centralised, Command 
and Control Monopolists, and don't actually like competition and a level
 playing field, instead preferring to use the levers of power to 
unfairly advantage their mates.</p>

<br><strong>Prime Minister Julia Gillard's hand overplayed</strong> 
<br>by Andre (sic) Bolt
<br>
<br><cite title="Quote">PRIME Minister Julia Gillard's improper pressure to kill a story of public interest has raised questions about her judgement.
<br>
<br>THE Prime Minister overstepped the line when she called the chairman and CEO of News Limited, John Hartigan.
<br>
<br>Calls that <strong>look like an attempt at censorship</strong> have many sinister overtones, with threats of inquiries and forced sales left hanging in the air.</cite>

<br>
<br>If you are in two minds about whether or not to give Andre your 
click, don't bother. It is standard Bolt - apparently he considered 
resigning because he felt News Ltd (<cite title="Quote">this company that I love</cite>)
 had caved in to Prime Ministerial pressure by withdrawing Milne's 
article and thereby had jeopardised free speech in Australia.
<br>
<br>The article is full of innuendo and outrage.
<br>
<br><cite title="Quote">You may blame News Limited for being weak, but 
never has it felt so politically vulnerable. Gillard had for weeks 
exploited Britain's News of the World phone hacking scandal to threaten 
News Limited with inquiries that might force it to sell some of its 
papers or address what the Greens called its "bias".
<br>
<br>Like the News of the World, News Limited is part of the Rupert 
Murdoch empire, and Prime Minister Gillard, long seething at the 
critical coverage of her performance by The Australian and The Daily 
Telegraph, now claimed the Australian papers also had "serious questions
 to answer".
<br>
<br>I have not the slightest doubt that Gillard's suggestions of an 
inquiry greatly worried News Limited, and influenced its overreaction to
 the Prime Minister's fury these past days.
<br>
<br>Whether Gillard specifically mentioned the threat of an inquiry in her "multiple" calls to News Limited executives <strong>I do not know</strong>.

<br>Ian
<br>Your billabong scenario was fantastic. Without construing it in 
terms of the billabong metaphor, I have been thinking for a month or so 
now that JG should just focus on bedding down into legislation those 
tasks that are now well under way. She has introduced more than enough 
reforms to secure her place in history as a great PM.
<br>
<br>The NBN, the ETS, National Disability Insurance, MRRT, and the 
Health and Aged Care reforms are all major renovations and improvements 
to our infrastructure and life styles.
<br>
<br>I think it is time just to use a judo approach to Abbott (not 
necessarily PJK's suggestion...... "he needs a judo chop to his neck" 
but the thought of that sounds exciting and welcome). 
<br>
<br>By this I mean that she should limit the debate to just allowing 
Abbott to dig his own holes, (as he continues to do nearly every day), 
and give him a passing shove of assistance to convey him to the bottom 
of each hole i.e. by letting Abbott's gaffs be the only thing she gives 
media attention to.
<br>
<br>As to her positive agenda, she should now just let the parliamentary
 processes quietly take care of it; consider the debates over. And as 
far as further policy development/implementation is concerned, she 
should just take a holiday at the billabong. </p>

  <p class="content">&nbsp;&nbsp;Morning all!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
 hear Andrew Bolt thinks the Prime Minister of this country 'has 
overstepped the mark' by picking up the phone to Chris Mitchell and John
 Hartigan in order to alert them to the fact that a slanderous article 
written by Glenn Milne had gone to press in their newspaper, The 
Australian?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, words fail me. To think of the unalloyed gall 
of the man who thinks he can use his paper pulpit to pass a character 
assessment on the Prime Minister of this country, after all she has had 
to put up with in the last few weeks from this media company wrt Craig 
Thomson, to say that HE thinks(I mean, at the end of the day Andrew Bolt
 is just a journalistic grub and low life parlaying his handsome 
features and way with words into the power to shape the political 
discourse...which at no time has stopped him being a grub), HE thinks 
the Prime Minister of this country has 'overstepped the mark' in seeking
 to get a slanderous story pulled from a Murdoch media outlet, is just 
the height of arrogance and condescencion. This man, and Tony Abbott, 
whom they say is the one behind the scenes getting the Murdoch media to 
do his dirty work for him, are both just getting too big for their 
boots, and it's about time they were taken down a peg or two hundred. 
They are not, along with those other 'DitchtheWitch'ety grubs, Alan 
Jones, Greg Smith, Mike Smith and Ray Hadley, the arbiters of the 
direction of our democracy, they should merely be players in the field-a
 level playing field.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; So, all I can say is, thank goodness for Dr Bob Brown, 
and reluctantly but at long last, the Gillard government, for finally 
growing a pair and deciding to stand up to these bullies and launch a 
parliamentary inquiry into the grubby media (wood)worms that have 
infected the planks and foundations of our democracy.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Let the Opposition and Tony Abbott's bumboys in the 
Murdoch media do their worst between now and the next election and 
whilst this Inquiry is being undertaken because they should rightly fear
 what can be done back to them once Pandora's Media Box is opened and 
given the best disinfection of all. Sunlight.</p>

  <p class="content">&nbsp;&nbsp;I found this statement in Laura Tingle's article very troubling indeed:
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'While The Australian acknowledged no attempt was made 
to contact the Prime Minister's office, comment is rarely if ever sought
 in relation to opinion pieces. This is a widely understood and accepted
 practice in journalism.'
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;So THAT'S why Murdoch has fostered the cult of the 'Opinion Piece'? No one accountable to no one, no how.</p>

<br>
<br>JOHN HOWARD: Yes, I believe very strongly that what brings countries
 more closely together than anything else is our shared values. That is

significant - America and Australia will always be closer than China and
 Australia because we have shared values.</cite>
<br>
<br>Yep, screw the many Chinese Australians here...stuff the fact that 
many Aussies eat Chinese food, watch Chinese films, shop at various 
Chinatowns, buy Chinese goods, and like me have a number of Chinese 
friends, are interested in Chinese news, have tutored students from 
China, Taiwan &amp; Hong Kong, have shared meals w/ Chinese university 
students in our unis, know and read comments of plenty of Chinese 
background social media contributors...or like Rudd actually speak 
Mandarin...and read occasionally Chinese papers to get a different slant
 on things, including seeing how the housing boom is going, their 
policies on climate change &amp; the types of disasters they have to 
deal with...not to mention reading books from Chinese &amp; 
Chinese-related authors...
<br>
<br>we will always be closer to America...according to the Font. 
<br>
<br>Well, won't that please Pauline Hanson &amp; One Nation.
<br>
<br>And some of the military hardware manufacturers/shareholders &amp; 
"Gawd! I make can make a ton of money in this private armaments company 
outa Coalition &amp; Neo-con think tank fear-mongering over China" 
types. 
<br>
<br>We're on to you Johnny boy.
<br>
<br>BTW, I reckon China will evolve into a functioning democracy down 
the road...and only feel the need to go berserker if we get more sh*t 
stirrers in America like the clown you played deputy dawg to...and 
cowboys who treat them the way Texans did Mexicans a good long time 
ago...and sometimes still do.
<br>
<br>When America has dealt appropriately w/ its neighbours...and created
 an EU style structure w/ Mexico, Central &amp; Sth America &amp; Canada
 &amp; Cuba etc...as it eventually must do...then we might see what you 
call "America" strengthen its reputation &amp; help secure its overall 
economy...and provide its workers &amp; other participants w/ a real 
"fair-go"...
<br>
<br>the EU may seem wobbly at present...but it will adapt and the 
transition to a cleaner greener, more diversified economy will spread 
benefits far &amp; wide...
<br>
<br>until America stops being parochial &amp; stubborn &amp; scared (Fox
 News?), tears down its walls...and integrates w/ its neighbours, it 
will only be a shadow of what it could be. 
<br>
<br>Relationships w/ shadows are odd, to say the least.

<br>Yes, I watched Lateline too...and the fella from the London School of Yawnenomics.

  <p class="content">Von Kirsdarke
<br>Thank you for your kind comments.&nbsp;&nbsp;You are right – the 
media generally doesn’t demand that Abbott produce any evidence to 
support his contentions. Unfortunately this is not science; it is raw 
politics where anything goes, particularly with a media that lacks 
objectivity and eschews scrutiny of political statements, except of 
course when it is pursuing its enemies, where the scrutiny is intense 
and obsessive.
<br>
<br>It was interesting though to read Paul Kelly’s short piece in <em>The Australian</em> this morning <em>Doubts increase about Tony Abbott's economic grasp</em> that opens with “<em>Tony
 Abbott has intensified doubts about his economic credentials and policy
 beliefs by leaving open all possible options for solutions to the 
manufacturing industry crisis.”</em> <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/opinion/doubts-increase-about-tony-abbotts-economic-grasp/story-e6frgd0x-1226124930809" rel="nofollow">www.theaustralian.com.au/.../story-e6frgd0x-1226124930809</a>
<br>
<br>It’s a pretty week slap on the hand from Kelly, but it does suggest 
emerging unrest with Abbott’s weathervane, back-the-horse-both-ways 
approach, and his ignorance about, and lack of understanding of 
economics. 
<br>
<br>All strength to your arm with your BSc studies.

  <p class="content">MY QUESTIONS FOR THE DAY
<br>
<br>If John Howard had served as PM from 2007 rather than 1996 onwards, 
and tried to pull off the Tampa &amp; children overboard scam now, do 
you think he would survive nigh on twelve years taking into account the 
24 hr news cycle now and the amount of blogs &amp; social network sites 
&amp; polling &amp; petitions out there compared to the late 90s/early 
2000s?
<br>
<br>Having learnt from Wikileaked documents that some of his Liberal 
caucus colleagues set him up in the leadership "because they wanted to 
put him in a position to fail" should Malcolm Turnbull go to the 
back-bench?...or even transform into an Independent? 
<br>
<br>Can Turnbull in the future win the confidence, or even leadership 
again, of his colleagues?...or have the Howard, Abbott, Minchin forces 
ensured that he will always play the part of mistrusted extra? 
<br>
<br>Why did Tony Windsor &amp; Rob Oakeshott decide to back Julia Gillard over Tony Abbott &amp; his party?
<br>
<br>How much longer will Julie Bishop be shadow foreign affairs minister? Why does Tony Abbott enjoy putting pins in her doll?

  <p class="content">FS, NormanK
<br>Thank you for having the strength to visit the Bolt site and report on it for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>My guess is that he is blindingly livid because he thought he had a 
scoop that would bring down the hated PM and her Government with her; he
 was salivating at that prospect and all the excitement and juicy copy 
that would generate, then News Limited executives got cold feet and 
pulled the plug, leaving him dangling without a story.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>No wonder he savages them for running scared from a Gillard 
onslaught.&nbsp;&nbsp;They have let the great man down.&nbsp;&nbsp;They 
have silenced Australia’s top megaphone from squeezing every last drop 
from the Milne story.&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter that it was factually 
inaccurate, who cares about the truth – certainly not Bolt.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>I imagine this episode has been one of Bolt’s worst moments – mega 
anticipation of a mega drama as a despised PM falls, mega praise for him
 for anticipating this mega scoop, mega gloating about his prescience 
and mega satisfaction at the destruction of a loathsome PM, and what 
does he get – none of the above and an abundance of egg all over his 
face.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it any wonder he is fuming on his blog and laying 
off the blame for the death of his mega story?&nbsp;&nbsp;His ego is 
damaged; there must be a therapist somewhere for bruised journalistic 
super-egos.

  <p class="content">Nasking,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about 'The 
Little Genral Mk II's' self-serving political statement, which 
sycophantically got a run on the ABC this morning, that Windsor and 
Oakeshott will both lose their seats at the next election? This from the
 man whose backside was so Araldited to the PM's chair he thought he 
could go on winning his seat at election after election forever. 'Cept 
he didn't, and he took his party down and out in Bennelong all the way 
to the Opposition benches with him. I mean, has he ever thought that 
Windsor and Oakeshott's electors might just be sentient enough to be 
able to see and feel the difference that their support of the present 
government has made to their lives, and then compare and contrast that 
with the way their vote was ritually taken nowhere and given nothing in 
return by the National Party for decades before that, and why, therefore
 they would want to rush back into that sort of setup?
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; All politics is flux, sure, but that sort of behaviour 
would exhibit no more in the common sense department than the sheep that
 they farm for a living. I just don't think a case of the 'Warm and 
Fuzzies' over being a 'Conservative Electorate' will cut it somehow.</p>

<br>
<br>Feral,
<br>I have to say I had a good chuckle last nite when Howard made his 
prediction...remembering how The Font managed to get so much wrong at 
the end &amp; lose his own seat, and power for the Coalition, as ya 
aptly mention.
<br>
<br>Howard is a stubborn fella desperate to create for himself a brill 
legacy...even if it means he has to throw a truckfull of manure the 
public's way:
<br>
<br><cite title="Quote">CHRIS UHLMANN: We stand now less than a 
fortnight away from the anniversary of September 11. Do you think it was
 a mistake to invade Iraq?
<br>
<br>JOHN HOWARD: No.
<br>
<br>CHRIS UHLMANN: What about the fact that we bled then-forces away from Afghanistan?
<br>
<br>JOHN HOWARD: Oh, that's not a theory I accept because the initial 
task in Afghanistan had been completed and the Taliban had been routed, 
and there had been an alliance formed behind Hamid Karzai, so there was 
reason to believe that the task in Afghanistan had been substantially 
completed.
<br>
<br>CHRIS UHLMANN: But clearly it wasn't.
<br>
<br>JOHN HOWARD: No, but I don't think you can blame the commitment in Iraq for that.</cite>

<br>
<br>"Task completed" eh? Sounds to me like "mission accomplished".
<br>
<br>I imagine another reason Howard wanted people to believe the task 
had been completed was so they could throw plenty of asylum seekers back
 to Afghanistan...and say "Look, we stopped the boats".&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <p class="content">With Thanks and a very comradely nod to Burgey on 
Poll Bludger, here's the link to Andre BumBolt's 
breathlessly-antici-&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>P</em></strong>ated! farticle:
<br>
<br><a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/opinion/prime-ministers-hand-overplayed/story-e6frfifx-1226125924173" rel="nofollow">www.heraldsun.com.au/.../story-e6frfifx-1226125924173</a>
<br>
<br>A bumbling whinging whimpering rant by a nasty cynical creepy bully,
 being called at last, by someone (*J*U*L*I*A*) who is his superior in 
every desirable aspect of humanity, including her hair colour. <img src="political-sword_files/smiley-kiss.gif" class="flag" alt="Kiss"> 
<br>
<br>There are lots of fun comments about BumBolt's nuts coming unscrewed
 on PB this morning, and meanwhile the Government is at last nearly 
ready to take on the <em>Merde</em>och Media's excesses.
<br>
<br>HOOORRRRRAAAAAHHH! BRING IT ON!
<br>
<br>It is <em>IGNORANCE</em>, of course, which allows BumBolt to command
 such a following. Ignorance of Australians on a massive scale, 
ignorance deliberately nurtured by <em>Merde</em>och. 
<br>
<br>Educated people just don't behave like Anal Jones or Pigs Ackerman, or Abbortt ftm (See, now they got me doing it. <img src="political-sword_files/smiley-smile.gif" class="flag" alt="Smile"> )* 
<br>
<br>Educated people? - I don't particularly mean University-educated, just people who have learnt proper manners.
<br>
<br>Proper manners? 
<br>
<br>Manners maketh Man. It's not a truism. It's a great Truth. 
<br>
<br>Respect others. Hear them out. 
<br>Expect and if necessary demand that you yourself be heard until you make your point.
<br>A principle if necessary to die for.
<br>
<br>Don't rudely interrupt. 
<br>Check out Pyne in Parliament!
<br>Clever, or witty, or helpful, or germane, or telling interjections are one thing. Pyne's are pathetic.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Ignorant people interrupt without ever acknowledging the validity of others' points of view.
<br>
<br>Then they say "You interrupt too!" when you call them on it, when it isn't true. 
<br>
<br>By the time people are out of their teens, it seems to me, they are either already civilized, or already committed ignoramuses. 
<br>The latter are thenceforth forever incapable of recognising validity and fallacy in reasoning. That is a great problem.
<br>
<br>But there are some who, <em>knowing</em> all that, consciously, 
maliciously, mischievously and cynically use that knowledge to blind and
 deafen the masses to the stark realities that are leading to every form
 of ill on this planet, from famine, through war, to global hotting-up 
and mass extinctions.
<br>
<br>BumBolt and Drunken Thug Milne are prime examples. 
<br>
<br>But their Supremo is an Adelaide-born alien-by-choice whom I hope 
will finally get his reward soon. He's done real well, I guess you'd 
say. He has dumbed-down the world, and using the ignorance he has 
created, fomented wars and created misery throughout the world to feed 
his ego. He is the nearest thing ever to a true-life Satan. He stands 
counter to all truth. 
<br>
<br>That's why good education is so vital, and why Religious schools are
 so poisonous, and why Abbortt in particular is so deadly a threat to 
Australia in particular. 
<br>
<br>What's the Dialectic about?
<br>er . . . hypothesis &gt;&gt;&gt;??? antithesis &lt;&lt;&lt;!!!
<br>. . . resolution in a new and higher synthesis ^ !
<br> . . . something like that.
<br>
<br>Well you can't have synthesis if all one side is doing is shouting down those who would create progress. 
<br>
<br>They are Vandals and Goths and Huns, would-be (and <em>actual!) </em>destroyers
 of civilization, but these ones do not come from beyond as did the 
originals, they come from within, though their ideas come from even more
 sinister sources which are truly global.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>This is not merely about niceties. It is about conflict resolution 
(but Abbortt wants to foment conflict of course, as do the others). It 
is about Truth, because while the loudest sounds around are BumBolt's 
bum-bolts (gee I'm funny) the quieter voices of good sense can barely be
 heard. It is about informed public policy. Upon civilized behaviour, 
based on goodwill and science, depends our beloved planet's survival.
<br> 
<br>Anal Jones, Pigs Ackerman, Andre BumBolt, your deliberate 
obfuscation of truth and fomentation of hatefulness makes you in my 
opinion global menaces. I hope my insulting but oh-so-apposite names 
stick to you like Aralditic poo, and I hope the same stuff gets on 
Archbigot Pell's knees, and on Abbortt's Opposition bench, until he's 
finally prised off just at the time *J*U*L*I*A* chooses, in time that is
 to leave the Coalons running around like headless chooks. With nothing 
left.
<br>
<br>*My first preference would be that there were no such hate-spitting 
ill-willed horrors in the world, but they really do merit my pet names 
for them, in fact I'm bloody proud of their aptness! Archbigot Pell, 
good eh? Oh yeah there's a lot that I am not to blame or praise for,

<br>Swordies might also wonder what good can come from such as this 
post. Me too, but one thing, it makes me feel better about the fact that
 such people exist, and another, I reckon the higher the feelings run 
now, the more toxic the boil, the sooner it will come to a head and the 
governemnt can lance it and squeeze the pus like BumBolt out and get 
some effective antisepsis happening. Well before next election, I hope 
the Government will have brought the poisoners of our society under the 
control of decency rules.

<br>Swordsfolks, bloggers elsewhere, do not under-estimate your power. You were better to <em>over</em>-estimate it if anything. Your single idea or expression (e.g. "the convoy of No Consequence <img src="political-sword_files/smiley-smile.gif" class="flag" alt="Smile">)

Horse-Shoe Nail parabolic pome I guess, and right now, on the issue of 
media concentration and bias, we are the very next line of defenders 
back from the Gillard Government itself, so though our enemies outgun us
 as the Israelis outgun the Palestinians, our strength is as <em>more than</em>
 the strength of ten, because our cause is just and our hearts are pure,
 and Truth is our Light on the Hill, and we got the Internet now, nyahh

  <p class="content">Something that really annoyed me about Chris Uhlmann's interview last nite:
<br>
<br><cite title="Quote">CHRIS UHLMANN: All the evidence that we have so 
far is that the Greens are on the rise and certainly they're taking 
votes from the Labor Party. Why wouldn't that continue?
<br>
<br>JOHN HOWARD: Well, they've made a couple of fundamental mistakes 
which have revealed their extreme nature. They have a deep anti-Israeli 
streak in them which frightens and concerns a lot of people. I mean, we 
saw the reaffirmation by Senator Rhiannon on her views on that. They 
have some very way-out foreign policies and way-out social policies. 
Australians don't like extremists. They don't like extremists in any 
spectrum of politics, and I think the Greens are increasingly seen as 
extremists. They didn't do so well in the last New South Wales election,
 and one of the reasons for that, of course, was this absurd attitude 
many of them have about Israel.</cite>
<br>
<br>Notice how Howard paints all Greens w/ the same anti-Israel brush. He deliberately misrepresents The Greens...
<br>
<br>we know in fact Bob Brown does not support Rhiannon's Israel boycott. Nor do others. 
<br>
<br>(interesting that Rhiannon was invited on SKY NEWS for a News Ltd ambush this weekend prior to Howard's comments)
<br>
<br>Anyway, notice how Chris Uhlmann fails to correct Howard, nor mention Brown's view. Suss.
<br>
<br>Notice that Howard &amp; Uhlmann both ignore the fact that The 
Greens have taken many stands &amp; come up w/ policies popular w/ many 
in the electorate...related to:
<br>
<br> - gas exploration &amp; coal mines on farms...give the farmers power.
<br>- DentiCare
<br>- fast trains between cities
<br>- no to detention centres outside of Australian territory. 
<br>- examine the failures &amp; cost of the War on Drugs.
<br>- have a media inquiry.
<br>
<br>From their site:
<br>
<br>- increase funding for services and education for the prevention and early detection of mental illness.
<br>
<br>- health funding that meets the increasing demands resulting from climate change.
<br> 
<br>- increase incentives for GPs and medical specialists to bulk bill.
<br>
<br>- increase the number of salaried GPs in order to increase access to GP services.
<br>
<br>- increase the number of well funded multipurpose community health 
care centres and services in regional, rural, and remote areas.
<br>
<br>- increase student places in medical, dental and nursing schools, 
and allied health courses, to address the shortage of health 
professionals with commensurate funding for staffing and facilities to 
ensure high quality training and mentorship programs.
<br>
<br>- increase the age pension.
<br>
<br>- reinstate the Commonwealth Dental Health Program to provide free public dental care for older people on low incomes.
<br>
<br>- increase funding to enhance the numbers, skills and salaries of community health nurses and workers in the aged care sector.
<br>
<br>- establish a funded scheme to undertake minor home renovations and 
installation of communication technologies to enable older people to 
remain in their own homes.
<br>
<br>- reforming the Child Care Benefit (CCB) and the Family Tax Benefit 
(FTB) to more accurately address the ability to pay, including 
substantially increasing the amount paid to low and middle income 
families;
<br>
<br>- increasing funding for children with special needs;
<br>
<br>- expand the Job Education and Training childcare scheme to assist parents who are studying.
<br>
<br>- provide incentives to workplaces which offer not-for-profit 
childcare in house and flexible childcare, including ‘childcare 
credits’, where workplaces assist parents to place children in childcare
 close to home.
<br>
<br>- public education infrastructure to be adequately funded for 
capital works and maintenance to meet the highest environmental 
sustainability standards and remain in public ownership and control.
<br>
<br>- invest the money saved from ending public subsidies to the very 
wealthiest private schools into a national equity funding programme for 
public schools.
<br>
<br>- allow full tax deductibility for any aids, devices, special 
equipment or services which directly assist people with disability in 
finding and maintaining employment.
<br>
<br>- provide parents, partners, relatives and friends who act as carers
 with eligibility for registration as professional carers and adequate 
support, including income and respite.
<br>
<br>- provide increased respite care services and facilities, in-home 
and emergency support, crisis accommodation and a range of supported 
accommodation options.
<br>
<br>- adequately resource pathways that support school leavers with 
disability to make the transition from school into meaningful 
employment, educational and vocational programs or other community-based
 activities.
<br>
<br>- reform the national transport plan and its funding mix to take account of environmental, social and economic goals.
<br>- major airports located to minimise social and environmental impacts.
<br>
<br>- fair compensation paid to those adversely affected by transport infrastructure development.
<br>
<br>- train services that are competitive with road transport – reliable, safe, fast and inexpensive.
<br>
<br>- more cycle ways and footpaths to encourage walking, cycling and 
public transport use in towns and cities to reduce the need for private 
car ownership and use.
<br>
<br>Seems pretty non-extremist to me. Short &amp; selective memories on 
the part of Howard &amp; Uhlmann I guess. And some usual suspect media.
<br>
<br>But I guess Howard would be embarrassed about his record when it 
came to age pensions, lack of affordable dentalcare, lack of mental 
health services &amp; no appropriate disability insurance scheme.
<br>
<br>Too busy paying for Bush's wars I guess...and political advertising, including WorkChoices mouse pads.

  <p class="content">Wednesday Bad Abbott
<br>
<br>The man who said "never ever" last night gave the man who says 
"circumstances change" a free pass to reintroduce WorkChoices, though we
 know from this same man that "the name WorkChoices is dead".
<br>
<br>John Howard passed the ball to Tony Abbott one more time for good luck.
<br>
<br><a href="http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/abbott-says-fair-work-laws-unbalanced-20110831-1jl2a.html" rel="nofollow">news.smh.com.au/.../...alanced-20110831-1jl2a.html</a>
<br>
<br>But you will notice from the last paragraph of that story, above 
which Shouldabeen pays lip service to workers' conditions, that he says:
<br>
<br>'But Mr Abbott said the coalition's policy would be "based on 
solving problems and not ideology. I think what it will aim to do is 
solve the problems that businesses have got," he said.'
<br>
<br>"...problems that businesses have got". Having to actually pay 
workers reasonable living rates of pay is one 'problem' businesses 
clearly have had for a long time, or we would never have had unions in 
the first place.
<br>
<br>When the Coalition takes government again, whenever that is, we will
 see the people of Australia punished for ever having elected a Labor 
Government, and then, perhaps, those same people will realise just how 
fooled they have been by conservative politicians.
<br>
<br>Too late, of course.

<br>
<br>JOHN HOWARD: Yes.

<br>CHRIS UHLMANN: Why?
<br>
<br>JOHN HOWARD: Because the experiment of a new paradigm - this hung 
parliament, this cosmopolitan Coalition - hasn't worked, and I predict 
at the next election - and I've made this prediction for a long time now
 - that there will be a clear outcome. I don't think they want the 
indecision and the influence of minorities that we've had over the last 
year.</cite>

<br>So, I presume normality for Howard is when one party dominates, such
 as The Liberals...w/ the help of another party that spoons them, The 
Nationals. 
<br>
<br>A Coalition of free traders, religious moralisers, war-mongers &amp; social agrarians. Nice.

<br>I hope you manage to shake off the dreaded lurgy in double-quick time.
<br>Traipsing over to Bolt's place was my one altruistic act for 
yesterday. A quick stroll around the garden to admire the first roses of
 the season and to whisper sweet nothings in the ears of the annuals who
 are starting to reappear in anticipation of Spring clears the toxins 
from my system.
<br>
<br>I did spend some time musing over how Bolt keeps up his level of 
outrage day after day, week after week. Perhaps he slaps himself around 
the face with a wet fish before sitting down to his keyboard. Or maybe 
he puts on Tom Waits' <em>Bone Machine</em> and attempts to hum along 
while keeping time by bashing his thumb with a hammer. All the while 
staring at his screen-saver of Julia Gillard saying 'moving forward' 
with seventeen different inflections. Whatever his secret is, it 
certainly seems to work for him.
<br>
<br>I'm not sure how he clears his mind afterwards though. 
<br>Perhaps a whale-song CD. 
<br>Or <em>Nana Mouskouri Sings Donovan</em>. 
<br>Maybe <em>The Tabernacle Boys' Choir's Homage to Frank Zappa's Joe's Garage</em>.
<br>That would certainly lift my spirits.</p>

  <p class="content">As announced an hour ago, the High Court has confirmed the injunction preventing asylum seekers being sent to Malaysia.
<br>
<br>The full judgements of the HC are at:
<br>
<br><a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2011/70.html" rel="nofollow">www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2011/70.html</a>
<br>
<br>There are three separate judgements which in essence get to the same conclusion by different paths. 
<br>
<br>The HC said that:
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;The relevant section by which the Minister is able to 
assert that asylum seekers can be transferred is s 198A of the Migration
 Act
<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;The ‘protection’ spoken of by s 198A(3)(a) of the Act 
refers to protection from refoulement i. e. asylum seekers being sent 
back to whence they came (at 63)
<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;That&nbsp;&nbsp;protection must be continuing protection, not merely current or transient protection (at 61)
<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;That&nbsp;&nbsp;whether (Malaysia) ‘provides access to 
protection’ and fulfils ‘human rights standards’ can only be assessed by
 reference to (Malaysian) domestic law (at 64, 66)
<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;That there must be an OBLIGATION (for Malaysia) to provide access to protection&nbsp;&nbsp;(at 135)
<br>
<br>And because.........
<br>
<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;(Malaysia) is not a signatory to the UNCR convention, and
<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;(Malaysia) is not bound to recognise refugee status by domestic law, and
<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; (Malaysia) does not do registration, documentation, or determination of refugee status (at 132, 249)
<br>
<br>..........then there is no obligation for Malaysia to provide continuing access for protection. 
<br>
<br>As a result, the Minister’s s 198A affidavit that (Malaysia) will 
provide access to protection, which is obligatory under the Act, is 
invalid.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mere hope, belief, or expectation that (Malaysia) 
will provide access to protection is insufficient (at 62).
<br>
<br>It probably remains open for the injunction to be lifted if a new affidavit by the Minister can cure the faults described above.

  <p class="content">&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I just say, wrt the High Court's decision today, 'Bugger!'
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Might I also add that we should be prepared to be 
swamped by Asylum Seekers of a particular stripe yet again. And no, just
 because the High Court has upheld David Manne's suit on behalf of the 
Asylum Seekers, doesn't make him right and the government's attempted 
solution for the farce that Asylum Seeker boat arrivals to Australia has
 become, wrong.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry, I like my refugees to be all the different 
nationalities under the sun that are suffering at the hands of their 
tormentors, not just a select few who have set up a well-functioning 
network to funnel them into Australia.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;And no, I do not approve of the Opposition's policies of
 Temporary Protectiojn Visas, Towing Boats back out to sea, and 
banishment to Nauru for a Kafkaesque period of Waiting for God(ot), or 
Tony Abbott's pleasure, on Nauru.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; All I really want is for our asylum seeker programme 
not to be abused by the hard of heart Conservatives, or the Bleeding 
Hearts that seem to support open slather, and definitely not the People 
Smuggling Business network. That's all.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that too much to ask people to agree to?
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; And as Recaptcha is my guide, it has reiterated just 
exactly what has gotten up my nose the most about the whole thing, 
'Business'. That is, Asylum Seeking has turned from a cause for 
compassion into a People Moving Business, whether they be genuine 
refugees, or no, as I think that is beside the point that is at the 
heart of this whole murky affair.

  <p class="content">NK,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; re the Malaysia Asylum Seeker decision. I have just now
 listened to an interview between Kim Landers and Paul Power from 'The 
Refugee Action Collective', and something very interesting was said, 
over and above the usual bromides of 'We love 'em all', and 'Suffer the 
little children, come unto me(even if they are shaving <img src="political-sword_files/smiley-wink.gif" class="flag" alt="Wink">
 ). Mr Power lamented that he thought that the government's aim to seek a
 Regional solution to the Asylum Seeker problem might now also see a 
slow down in his group's aim to bring about improved conditions for all 
refugees in the Asian region. That is, I think he could see a chink of 
light with the Gillard government's deal with Malaysia that would have 
seen a start to improving their attitude to refugees in their country, 
in general. Now, with the decision of the High Court, that has been put 
in jeopardy. So, now I don't think that I am as much of a hard nut as 
some have tried to make me out to be because one of the groups 
intimately involved in this area, and, it seems, without a barrow other 
than humane and fair treatment of all refugees in the region to push, is
 on my philosophical side wrt the way I have viewed this issue and the 
government's attempts to deal with it and find a solution to it.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; As Chris Bowen himself just said, wtte, "I was proud of
 the fact that I had designed what I thought was an elegant solution 
which would have broken the People Smuggler's Business Model, and had 
given the opportunity for 4000 genuine refugees who did not have the 
money or the inclination to take a perilous journey on a boat, the 
opportunity to settle in this country."
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; And so says all of me! <img src="political-sword_files/smiley-smile.gif" class="flag" alt="Smile"></p>

  <p class="content">Bottom line on the High Court judgement today - 
from my point of view - is that the Courts seem to be speaking for the 
majority of Australians (as per a number of opinion polls) that want to 
see refugees processed in Australia and only kept in Prison Camps while 
their quarantine status is checked.
<br>
<br>I still don't get that the Australian Government can tell where and 
when the boats leave other countries - but those same countries can't 
find those responsible for the horrible trade of people 
smuggling.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also don't get why those that are desperate 
enough to make the risky trip are the ones punished while others are 
making a squillion out of the process.
<br>
<br>Hopefully this is the beginning of the end of the policy of both 
sides of politics to treat humans inhumanly solely on the basis they 
couldn't afford to arrive here on a 747.

  <p class="content">The regional hub concept for dealing with refugees 
who arrive in South East Asia from the West and North West of this 
region of ours, divorced from short-sighted preoccupations about 
Australia and Malaysia only, IS an elegant solution as Chris Bowen says 
of it.
<br>
<br>A hub that takes all refugees that end up in this region, processes 
them in an humanitarian and respectful manner, and then finds places all
 around the world where duly processed asylum seekers are seen to be in 
the 'queue' by the simple fact of their having passed through the hub, 
is precisely how the situation of displaced people should be handled. 
Everywhere, actually.
<br>
<br>The model, successfully established, could have set up mirroring 
hubs for Africa and Europe, for the United States and Central/South 
America. Instead of 'edge of town', middle of the Indian Ocean detention
 sites, the seeking of asylum process could have been streamlined, 
placed into a set of international conventions, and stripped of danger 
and abuses.
<br>
<br>As I have always understood the expressed intentions of Prime 
Minister Gillard and her government, this was how the "regional hub" to 
be located in Malaysia would operate upon its full development.
<br>
<br>That possibility has been derailed, which will more than likely 
simply return us all, Australians, Australia, refugees, and people 
smugglers, back to an ad hoc non-process for handling asylum seekers' 
legitimate search for safety and freedom that puts lives at risk.
<br>
<br>Did I see an instant's concern for refugees on the 'told you so' 
smirk across Scott Morrison's face when he was interviewed about the 
High Court decision? Not so much as a whisker, even though sending 
refugees to Nauru was just as comprehensively rendered unacceptable by 
the same decision.
<br>
<br>In his hurry, and that of other Coalition spokespeople, to score 
political points over the lives of real people fleeing oppression and 
danger, there was nothing of compassion, nothing of a real alternative 
solution, nothing but oneupmanship.
<br>
<br>Hollow, vicious, dismissive. Rather like the Coalition's Pacific Solution itself.</p>

<br>
<br>It is my understanding that Australian authorities rarely know when a
 boat leaves Indonesia and certainly never know the point of departure. 
Sometimes the Indonesian Coast Guard (whatever it is called) spot a boat
 as it enters international waters and pass the information on. 
Sometimes the boat itself sends a message to Australian authorities in 
order to ensure that they are tracked and met. Sometimes, as in last 
December one gets through the net and makes it all the way to Christmas 
Island undetected.
<br>
<br>There are many problems in detecting departures and arrivals. 
Because they are small wooden boats they don't show up on radar and have
 to be spotted by direct line-of-sight.
<br>
<br>An item on one of the current affairs programmes recently 
highlighted the problems Indonesian authorities face in trying to 
prevent departures. Since the Indonesian task force was established 
about six months ago, charged with the job of stopping boats leaving the
 coast, not one boat has been detected and stopped. It is not as though 
they chug out of an established harbour , trailing streamers behind 
them. Helicopter footage shows that the coastline is covered in heavy 
foliage with a myriad of small creeks that are so numerous that it is 
almost impossible to police. The smugglers move the point of embarkation
 all of the time - hiding in the mangroves until dark to depart.
<br>
<br>The only interventions that have been successful have been those 
based on informants or surveillance and the venture is brought to an end
 while they are still on the mainland.
<br>
<br>In terms of who gets punished, Indonesia has only recently made 
people smuggling illegal in that country and a large part of the Bali 
Framework involves tracking the money and punishing the people who are 
profiting from these enterprises. It is reasonable to assume that more 
convictions will occur as the teams gain experience and data and warm to
 their task but as with all black market enterprises as soon as you take
 one trader off the street, two more pop up to take their place.
<br>
<br>As for the asylum seekers being 'punished', you and I might have 
very different views on that. I saw the sending of them to Malaysia as 
being in the same vein as fining speeding drivers, both for their own 
good and others who share the same environment with them. I am open to 
suggestions but as far as I can see the only way to Disincentivise 
Unsafe Maritime Excursions is to dissuade people from 'wanting' to 
embark on a boat trip. The alternative is that we welcome them with open
 arms and turn a blind eye if hundreds of them drown at sea every year.
<br>
<br>On-shore mandatory detention is one aspect that I have a completely 
open mind about. Provided health, identity and security checks can be 
carried out there is very little reason to keep people locked up while 
they wait for their applications to be processed.</p>

  <p class="content">Bsa Bob,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ruling also 
puts the kybosh on the Opposition's hopes of sending Asylum Seekers to 
Nauru. They haven't signed the Refugee Convention either. I have also 
heard it said that even if they did sign it a Coalition government would
 have trouble because the Ruling is about the concept of Offshore 
Processing, per se. However, no doubt after being paid a very big bribe 
by the Coalition, or, as Scott Morrison said today in order to make the 
Nauru Solution work, "We could always buy Nauru for about $500000.", 
something could be worked out. I think it was Prof Don Rothwell who said
 that he thought the High Court Ruling applied to any offshore 
processing, signed Refugee Convention or not. What he also said was, and
 this applies to both the Government and the Opposition's hopes for 
Offshore Processing in another country, that if the government signed a 
Bilateral Treaty, which IS legally-binding on both signatory countries, 
then they would be able to progress with the policy. He also said it 
doesn't have to be passed through our parliament because a Bilateral 
Treaty does not have to be ratified by parliament. Therefore can't be 
blocked by The Greens and the Coalition opportunistically joining hands.
 However, on the other hand a modifdication of the Migration Act does.</p>

  <p class="content">Michael,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, you could tell 
how much concern for the plight of Asylum Seekers the Opposition really 
has by the speed with which they changed from villification pre-election
 and cries of 'Stop the Boats!'&nbsp;&nbsp;which rang out across the 
land; to faux compassion as soon as it seemed as though the government 
had found a real and permanent way to 'Stop the Boats'; to then mouthing
 the Hard Man line of, 'Temporary Protection Visas+Nauru+Tow 'Em Away'.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; To the Coalition all Asylum Seekers who come here by 
boat are are a means to an end. That end being returning to power.</p>

<br>Nauru have taken the first steps towards signing the Refugee 
Convention. I doubt that it is the done deal that Morrison keeps saying 
that it is but they have begun the process.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Michael 
<br>Agree with you entirely. A hub where asylum seekers could 'come' 
rather than being 'sent' is what the Bali Framework is trying to work 
towards and it needs to be somewhere that people fleeing conflict or 
persecution can reach in a relatively safe manner. Nauru doesn't even 
begin to fit the bill in that regard but I am left wondering about Manus
 Island as well. I don't know if there is a reputable ferry system but 
there would need to be something like that in order for any centre 
created there to become a hub.</p>

  <p class="content">Some interesting responses to today's High Court decision here and elsewhere.
<br>
<br>My thoughts are still collecting through a lurgical haze.
<br>
<br>Some suggestions.
<br>
<br>Perhaps the minister (and the Prime Minister) could take advice from
 the department and particularly, Department of Immigration and 
Citizenship Secretary, Andrew Metcalfe and rethink.
<br>
<br>Perhaps they could also wait until October 7 and take note of the Joint Parliamentary Committee Report and act on that.
<br>
<br>Perhaps they could use the recent report by Centre for Policy Development as a blue print for the future.
<br>
<br>But then again.
<br>
<br>Perhaps any of those courses of action may be too sensible to consider.</p>

  <p class="content">NK,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew Nauru had 'started the process of signing the 
Refugee Convention'. I think you could safely say that they will not 
complete the process until 2013, if and only if the Coalition win the 
next election, at which point, via this judgement today especially, they
 can thus use their signatures on the Refugee Convention as a bargaining
 chip to extract moolah and services from the Coalition.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Interestingly, there are others on Twitter who also see
 this decision from the High Court today as an opportunity for the 
government to get Malaysia and PNG over the line with the Refugee 
Convention.</p>

  <p class="content">&nbsp;&nbsp;A few interesting points I have picked up in the washup from the High Court decision on Asylum Seekers yesterday.
<br>* Scott Morrison is wrong to suggest that by paying lip service to 
the UNHCR Refugee Convention as a result of passing acceptance of it 
through the Nauruan Parliament that that equates with satisfaction of 
the standards the High Court has held the Australian government to wrt 
it's deal with Malaysia, is not in fact the case. According to Marion Le
 on AM, what the High Court ruling means is that Nauru would have to set
 up a Refugee Processing Centre which satisfied all the requirements set
 out by the UNHCR before it could get a tick of approval. That is, Nauru
 would have to deliver prompt processing of asylum seeker claims before 
sending the genuine refugees on to Australia. Which again gives the lie 
to Coalition assertions that using Nauru would deter People Smugglers.
<br>* A caller to Adam Spencer on ABC Sydney this morning validated ny 
concerns about the People Moving Enterprise in Indonesia and the Asylum 
Seekers who are taking advantage of Australian's generosity of spirit 
wrt Asylum Seekers, as he said that not once, but 3 times, he had gone 
to Indonesia on business and stayed in a 4 Star Serviced Apartment, 
where he met in the lift groups of 'refugees' who stated that they were 
just staying there in these expensive serviced apartments before they 
took a boat to Australia. Hardly your poor, downtrodden masses, 
struggling to be free'. Yes, they have come from war-torn countries like
 Afghanistan, but they hardly seem the sort who have escaped the country
 recently in fear for their lives.
<br>* An asylum seeker in Malaysia, spoken to by the ABC said that a 
potential solution for the government was to increase the intake 
markedly from the Refugee Camps in the region and decrease the number of
 Asylum Seekers taken after coming here by boat. That is, establish a 
queue in the camps and you would stop asylum seekers jumping the queue 
and jumping on a boat. Well, to a large degree he thought.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; So, it seems there is some wriggle room for the 
government to achieve their aim of breaking up the People Smugglers' 
business but still open up more places for refugees of all stripes and 
ability to pay.</p>

they said, “We're the most cosmopolitan city on Earth,” but it doesn't 
feel English. 
<br>
<br>I had a Californian friend come over two months ago, walk down the 
Kings Road and said to me, "Well where are all the English people?" And,
 I mean, I love having different cultures around, but when the parent 
culture kind of dissipates, you're left thinking, "Well, what's going 
on?" </cite>
<br>
<br>Not an English city eh? I was born in London and found this to be an
 offensive comment by Cleese...bein' funny doesn't make ya immune from 
sayin' dopey, xenephobic things obviously.
<br>
<br>Interesting that Uhlmann didn't pick Cleese up on it. Same goes for some other ABC personnel. Not good.
<br>
<br>I take it the show Hustle would be more English w/out Adrian Lester as Michael "Mickey Bricks" Stone.
<br>
<br>Perhaps England would be more English if they sent The Kumars at No. 42 overseas?
<br>
<br>I guess English humour would be funnier w/out Lenny Henry.
<br>
<br>I take it Misfits would be far more English if it was an all-white 
cast...Nathan Stewart-Jarrett as Curtis Donovan &amp; Antonia Thomas as 
Alisha Bailey are obviously not English enuff to suit some people's 
refined tastes.
<br>
<br>Antonia bein' born in London &amp; attending Bristol Old Vic Theatre School may not be English enuff for some.
<br>
<br>How does the song go?:

<br>
<br>I do agree w/ Cleese's assessment of the media however:
<br>
<br><cite title="Quote">JOHN CLEESE: And then we have of course the 
worst press in the world, you know, instigated by a countryman of yours.
 And their standards just go down and down and down. They no longer even
 care whether the story's right. They just make sure it isn't 
actionable. And that doesn't improve one's quality of life.
<br>
<br>CHRIS UHLMANN: What do you make of what we've seen of that recently?
<br>
<br>JOHN CLEESE: They had it coming to them and I hope it goes on coming
 to them. Not that it's just the Murdoch people. I mean, The Daily Mail,
 papers like that, I think it's coming them too.</cite>

<br><cite title="Quote">He claims a senior member of the Genovese crime 
family told him: "No one will bother you here. If you catch a cold, we 
will find out who you got it from. You know, we have much in common … We
 are industrialists."
<br>
<br>One of his jobs was cleaning the shower stalls. "It wasn't terribly 
exciting work," he says. "You just put soap on the wall and focus a hose
 on it. There was a social component to it, however. All of these guards
 from all over coming into the shower to watch this millionaire clean 
the shower."
<br>
<br>He is dismissive of the case against him and puts part of the blame for his troubles on his former rival Rupert Murdoch.
<br>
<br>"The myth is that the price war put so much pressure on our profits 
that I was forced to steal money to maintain my opulent lifestyle. It's 
part of the whole News Corporation myth-making apparatus," Black claims.
<br>
<br>He adds: "Rupert always says reasonably nice things about me, but 
then he throws in something like that for effect. I don't really blame 
Rupert. He's not a non-friend. Rupert is just Darwinian."
<br>
<br>Black weighs in too on the phone-hacking row. "Murdoch deserves all 
the credit for building so powerful a company that most of its

  <p class="content">Nasking,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been thinking 
about the issue of a solution to the exploitation of the country's 
generosity wrt Asylum Seekers and genuine refugees, the Regional Hub and
 Soke/Bali Process model, and what Australia can use to effect a new 
solution to the Processing of Refugees such that it takes into account 
all who want refuge from all the areas of conflict in the world. Also 
taking into account, more flexibly, the fluid nature of conflict change 
so as to help quickly those people fleeing an immediate threat to their 
well-being, as opposed to giving up most of our places to well-organised
 People Smuggling networks and their willing paying customers.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I think that the government should maintain their 
commitment to the Bali Process. However, in light of the High Court 
Ruling yesterday it appears to me that unless they make a serious 
investment in those countries that they want to host Regional Processing
 Centres, such that they satisfy the requirements of the Refugee 
Convention, with proper access to Medical, Education and Legal Services,
 then they will just have to re-instate Onshore Processing, which will 
only give a Green light to the People Smugglers.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; If they agree to locate and pay for the infrastructure 
in those countries, or agree a co-pay arrangement with them, then I 
still believe that the Regional Processing Solution can work.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Definitely they should be moving ahead with PNG to get 
them up to speed in this way. I'm not sure about the speck of bird guano
 in the middle of the Pacific, Nauru, it may or may not even be in the 
Region, per se. However I would be exploring agreements with other 
places such as Bougainville, Samoa, Tonga, Solomon Islands, Thailand, 
Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and any other nation in the area who would like 
to see the investemnt and business such a Centre would generate for 
their countries.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I just believe in my heart of hearts(and, yes, I do have one when it comes to refugees, DMW <img src="political-sword_files/smiley-wink.gif" class="flag" alt="Wink">
 ), that we must disrupt the People Smuggling networks, and we must 
develop an enduring solution which will provide opportunities on a level
 playing field basis to all refugees, rich or poor, in an even-handed 
fashion.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that too unreasonable?</p>

<br>FS @ 8:29 AM,
<br>wrt the caller to a radio station.
<br>
<br>I hope you treated his story with a healthy dose of scepticism. 
<br>
<br>I ask myself is this person giving all the story? Then I might get 
into a bit of a 'conspiracy' mode and ask'Could this person be a Young 
Lib' whipping up a bit of hysteria'?
<br>
<br>Did Spencer ask this caller if he notified the Department of Foreign Affairs or any other authorities? If not why not?
<br>
<br>Surely, if a person when overseas, comes across some information 
that relates to apparently illegal activity that affects their own 
country they have some responsibility to pass on that information so 
that authorities may be assissted in stopping that activity?</p>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; No, the caller to Adam Spencer sounded anything but a 
Young Liberal. He actually sounded genuinely shocked to come across the 
truth of the matter.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Should he have reported the incident to the 
authorities? What could he have reported? Asylum Seekers were staying in
 a 4 Star Serviced Apartment before jumping on a boat to Australia? 
What's illegal about that? Where is it stated they have to live in a 
slum in Indonesia before leaving there for here?

<br>I've always wondered why John Howard &amp; co. proceeded w/ the 
construction of Christmas Island Detention Centre as a non-temporary 
detention centre in 2003 if they were convinced they'd "stopped the 
boats".
<br>
<br>I'd like to see more refugees accepted into Australia, drawing from 
the hot spots and alleviating pressures on some neighbouring countries. 
And places like Somalia &amp; surrounds.
<br>
<br>And eventually we'll pull out of Afghanistan...would be good to take some desperate people w/ us.
<br>
<br>Processing needs to be speeded up...and I don't think all need to be put in detention centres. It's cruel &amp; archaic. 
<br>
<br>BTW, it irks me to see tomatoes by the tons &amp; tons bein' chucked
 around in Spain when so many African-originated fruit &amp; vege 
pickers/packers are basically underfed there...and starvin' in Somalia 
etc. It's not a good look, even tho tomatoes aren't protein. 
<br>
<br>We sent some money to Save the Children Fund back on the 19th of 
July related to the East Africa food crisis...but feel the need to send 
more...a dreadful situation. Been watching it unfold via Anderson-Cooper
 on CNN &amp; elsewhere. 
<br>
<br>Was thinking about Ellis Island after it was mentioned in a comment on ABC 24 this morn.
<br>
<br>Did you know the following?:
<br>
<br>During and immediately following World War II Ellis Island was used 
to intern German merchant mariners and enemy aliens - American civilians
 or immigrants detained for fear of spying, sabotage, etc. Some 7,000 
Germans, Italians and Japanese would be detained at Ellis Island.

  <p class="content">Lyn, 
<br>thnx for the useful links. Yer efforts are well appreciated by many, as aptly noted by TT above.
<br>
<br>From Tim Dunlop @ The Drum Opinion:
<br>
<br><cite title="Quote">The impossibility of journalism
<br>
<br>News Ltd did the right thing in withdrawing a Glenn Milne article 
that its lawyers deemed may have defamed the PM, and they responded 
correctly in offering an unreserved apology to Julia Gillard for the 
false claims the article made. Had they left it at that, we might have 
been able to applaud their professionalism, if not their original 
judgement.
<br>
<br>Instead, they have seen fit to try and walk back their contrition 
and suggest that somehow the PM is at fault or has overreacted. So much 
for the unreserved apology. We can ignore the whining of their 
baby-in-chief, Andrew Bolt, who has tried to turn the whole miserable 
event into a story about himself, but it is less easy to ignore comments
 from News Ltd CEO, John Hartigan.
<br>
<br>Responding to the Prime Minister's remarks that News Ltd ignored 
basic journalistic standards in not contacting her about the claims 
Milne made in his now-discredited article, Mr Hartigan called the PM 
"pedantic".
<br>
<br>"While The Australian acknowledged no attempt was made to contact 
the Prime Minister's office, comment is rarely if ever sought in 
relation to opinion pieces," he said.
<br>
<br>"This is a widely understood and accepted practice in journalism."
<br>
<br>His comments almost beggar belief. Milne's "opinion piece" was based
 on certain claims of fact about the PM and the idea that he shouldn't 
seek confirmation from the subject of his article is nonsense on a 
stick. First-year journalism students know that they are obliged to 
contact their subjects under such circumstances and Milne's failure to 
do so is horribly compounded by Mr Hartigan's attempt to justify it.
<br>
<br>To understand how stupid Hartigan's claim is, you only have to look 
to how key people at News Ltd reacted in regard to another matter of 
defamation...</cite>

  <p class="content">Geez, I hate it when I get as angry as I am this 
morning and I'm probably breaking one of my own rules here but I suspect
 it will be my last comment on asylum seekers for the foreseeable 
future.
<br>In the great plethora of comment today on the High Court's decision 
and the possible ways forward, almost no-one speaks of the events of 
December 15th last year.
<br>Even Julian Burnside makes no mention of the loss of life at sea. 
Instead he spends an inordinate amount of time complaining about the 
cost of current policies.
<br>Perhaps I have misunderstood this remark, feel free to point out the error in my interpretation.
<br>
<br><cite title="Quote">We can assume that the Australian Government 
intended to treat the 4,000 refugees resettled from Malaysia as part of 
our offshore resettlement quota. It presently offsets informal boat 
arrivals against the offshore resettlement quota. Accordingly the 
Malaysian arrangement was neutral on total refugee arrival rates. So it 
was not going to reduce the number of refugees received in Australia 
each year, but it was going to cost the Australian taxpayer about $200 
million. Weird economics.</cite>
<br>
<br><strong>Malaysian solution: always a bad idea</strong> by Julian Burnside
<br>
<br><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/2865250.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/2865250.html</a>
<br>
<br>No Mr Burnside, the 4,000 refugees from Malaysia were going to be on
 top of our annual quota so the Malaysia arrangement was not neutral on 
refugee arrival rates - it actually increased them. Which means that it 
was <cite title="Quote">not going to reduce the number of refugees received in Australia each year</cite>
 but then who has ever said that this was the Labor Government's 
ambition? Certainly not the Minister and not the Prime Minister. Is it 
to be assumed from this remark that this is Mr Burnside's ambition - to 
reduce the number of refugees taken by Australia each year? So 
presumably it would not be <cite title="Quote">weird economics</cite> if the $200 million <strong>was</strong> spent on reducing our intake. Talk about weird.
<br>
<br>To be fair to Mr Burnside, much of the rest of his article makes 
reasonable sense. But I am obliged to ask again - where is the concern 
for asylum seekers becoming shark food?
<br>
<br>Pulling together much of what I have read this morning, it would 
seem that the general consensus is that we welcome boat arrivals 
regardless of how many there are or how many lose their lives attempting
 the journey, process them quickly even if their security checks can't 
be finalised and as a result sleep better at night dreaming of our 
generosity. We will of course have to ask our media to please not show 
us any more footage of splintered timbers and empty life-jackets. Or 
parents burying children who have drowned at sea attempting the voyage. 
Or children burying parents. Or strangers burying those without family 
on this continent. We wouldn't want to disturb our sleep.
<br>
<br>Perhaps we could keep bleeding hearts like me quiet by instructing 
the Navy to provide a ferry service to replace the leaky fishing boats. 
"If you can make it to Jakarta, we'll bring you the rest of the way." 
Why stop there? Why not organise flights out of Afghanistan? And Iran? 
And Sri Lanka? And Iraq? Too bad if some of those we bring here turn out
 not to be genuine refugees but simply opportunists - we can always fly 
them back home again at our expense. Weird economics but we could hold 
up our heads in world forums on the subject.
<br>
<br>Refugees in our region need somewhere to which they can travel 
safely of their own volition to have their status verified. Then, and 
only then, can signatories of the Refugee Convention feel confident that
 scarce resources are being targeted at those who truly need them. 
<br>
<br>Let's bite the bullet and agree to take 30,000 more properly 
assessed refugees out of neighbouring countries and make it clear that 
this is our preferred option. 
<br>
<br>Oh, and torpedo the fishing boats so that we don't spoil our evening meals with images of wailing relatives.</p>

<br>I bet Ad astra &amp; others have more than a few further stuff-ups 
&amp; flipflops by Abbott since then they could add to the list for a 
new post. <img src="political-sword_files/smiley-smile.gif" class="flag" alt="Smile">
<br>
<br><cite title="Quote">THE ABBOTT COCK-UPS:
<br>
<br>- The latest email saga…the opportunistic politicising of natural disasters
<br>
<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;Climate change science is “absolute crap”:
<br>
<br> “The argument is absolute crap. However, the politics of this are 
tough for us. Eighty per cent of people believe climate change is a real
 and present danger.”
<br>
<br> - An $11 billion black hole to costings revealed during the election under his crafty leadership
<br>
<br>- Walking out of press conference when queried over costings
<br>
<br>- Broadband: lack of knowledge as demonstrated on 7:30 Report…&amp; failure to sell policy
<br>
<br> - Pathetic attempt to buy Andrew Wilkie’s support…poorer 
negotiating skills than Gillard’s led to Independents supporting ALP to 
form government
<br>
<br>- Cycling for 10 days during election campaign
<br>
<br>- Promoting himself in Speedos that led to him eventually burning them in public
<br>
<br>- The pathetic Neil Mitchell interview where Abbott couldn’t respond
 honestly over whether the shadow cabinet had rolled him or not on the 
payments to stay-at-home Mums idea:
<br>
<br>Mitchell: “What was your plan for a $10,000 payment to stay-at-home mums?”
<br>
<br>Abbott: “There isn’t any such plan.”
<br>
<br>Pretty definitive.
<br>
<br>But Mitchell pressed on: “It’s a simple thing. Was this discussed, was it raised, was it rejected?”
<br>
<br>Abbott: “There was a discussion about many things and I am not 
saying that this wasn’t one of the things that was discussed but the 
important thing is what we decided – and what we decided is that the 
reckless spending must stop.”
<br>
<br>- Travelling to UK conservative convention instead of visiting 
troops first…followed by a gung-ho, action man photo-op with gun in 
hand:
<br>
<br> “I thought it was important to do this trip justice, I didn’t want to get here entirely in a jetlagged condition…”
<br>
<br>- Running away from a one-on-one economic debate with Julia Gillard…including saying the following ridiculous comment:
<br>
<br>“Now, are you suggesting to me that when it comes from Julia, no doesn’t mean no?”
<br>
<br>- Views on homosexuality as spoken on Channel Nine’s 60 Minutes:
<br>
<br> “I probably feel a bit threatened, as so many people do. It’s a fact of life.”
<br>
<br>- Admitting he’s sometimes a bullsh*tter on 7:30 Report:
<br>
<br>“I know politicians are going to be judged on everything they say 
but sometimes in the heat of discussion you go a little bit further than
 you would if it was an absolutely calm, considered, prepared, scripted 
remark… The statements that need to be taken absolutely as gospel truth 
are those carefully prepared scripted remarks.”
<br>
<br>These were some of the great Abbott moments that I could recall off 
the top of my head…the quotes with some help from the following useful 
blog posts:</cite>

  <p class="content">FS,
<br><em>Sounds like you're just trying to blow holes in my evidence just for the sake of it.</em>
<br>
<br>I was not attempting to blow holes in your argument even 'just for 
the sake of it'. Questioning the veracity of the story, yes. Being 
sceptical of it, yes. Looking at it from other angles, yes.
<br>
<br>I would no more treat the story of a caller to an ABC talkback 
segment as 'evidence' than I would treat the story of a caller to any 
other talkback show as 'evidence'.
<br>
<br>Just as we should be sceptical of what we read in newspapers or 
blogs we should treat with scepticism what we hear and/or see on the 
broadcast media. Just because something is written in a newspaper or 
blog or something is said on the radio or tv does not make it true.
<br>
<br>To ask what is illegal about staying in a 4 star hotel takes the wrong end of what I put.
<br>
<br>On the presumption that the 'People Moving Enterprises' are illegal 
then this person had information that related to the potential 
commissioning of a crime. 
<br>
<br>Any information that helps prevent a crime would surely be as 
valuable as any information that helps find the person/s that committed a
 crime.
<br>
<br>If we want to stop people from undertaking the perilous journey, 
surely assissting in stopping them leave in the first place is something
 that we should offer any help in happening.</p>

  <p class="content">My wife just rang and said the PM was across the 
road earlier, at the primary school. Feedback from staff who met her was
 very good. Apparently she's charming, lovely, sweet, down-to-earth 
&amp; easy to talk to...very approachable (nothing like some of the 
negative media representations, typically)...
<br>
<br>and she helped pick up the morale of the primary school students 
&amp; staff who had recently gone thru the Logan fire disaster and the 
death of school mates.
<br>
<br>The PM took the time to have plenty of photos taken w/ all who wanted them...which was lots of people.
<br>
<br>Good on the PM for coming to our area to lift spirits...and motivate the students &amp; staff.

  <p class="content">Folks
<br>I haven’t bought into the asylum seeker issue post High Court 
because of the uncertainty that now abounds about any offshore 
processing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Coalition speakers seem confident that the Nauru 
option would pass the test, which is what one would expect them to say, 
but David Manne and Julian Burnside and Don Rothwell are quite uncertain
 about Nauru.&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth is that no one knows, and cannot know
 unless and until it is tested in the High Court, as I expect it will be
 should the Government propose to use Nauru, or for that matter Manus 
Island.&nbsp;&nbsp;I imagine that clients of David Manne would want him 
to mount another High Court challenge should the Government attempt to 
move asylum seekers to those venues.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I see no point in 
trying to second-guess what might happen, or the outcome of any High 
Court challenge.
<br>
<br>What I would like though is for all those who have successfully 
mounted the High Court challenge, David Manne and any of his team of 
lawyers, and Greens Sarah Hanson-Young, or any other asylum seeker 
advocate, to answer these questions:&nbsp;&nbsp;“What do you now expect 
in the way of boat arrivals at Christmas Island from Indonesia?” and 
“Since virtually everyone wants to see the cessation of asylum seeker 
boat arrivals on our shores, and the breaking of the people smuggler 
trade, how do you suggest this be accomplished?”&nbsp;&nbsp;Tony Jones 
did not ask this of David Manne last night on <em>Lateline</em>, but Jon Faine did this morning on radio 774 Melbourne, and Eleanor Hall did of Sarah Hanson-Young in <em>The World Today</em>,
 and the question has been asked obliquely by others, but in every 
instance I have heard, the interviewee has skirted around the question 
with lots of suitable touchy-feely words, but no direct 
answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;They either had no plausible answer or chose not to 
verbalize it.
<br>
<br>Since it seems that some of the people smugglers and their clients 
were willing to ‘test the waters’ to see if the Government had the 
resolve to deport to Malaysia new arrivals after the announcement, and 
that was long before the High Court challenge, and since the Court’s 
decision is now known by all people smugglers and their able-to-pay 
clients, why would they now not send boatload after boatload in the 
knowledge that all Australia can now do (unless and until alternative 
arrangement are made) is to accept and process them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Making 
predictions is hazardous in this arena, but it seems a sure bet that we 
will see many more boats now arrive.
<br>
<br>Would those who on the one hand have heartfelt empathy towards 
asylum seekers and advocate their processing in Australia, yet don’t 
want them to risk their lives on unsafe boats, tell us all how they 
would stem the flow.

  <p class="content">POLICE have alleged staff for Liberal Senator Mary 
Jo Fisher pressured a security guard and Foodland supermarket staff to 
drop assault and theft charges. 
<br>Fisher, 48, appeared in the Adelaide Magistrate's Court this morning
 charged with theft and assault during an alleged incident at Frewville 
Foodland in December last year.
<br>
<br>Opening the tria, police prosecutor Sergeant Brendon Beh said Fisher
 attempted to leave the store without paying for groceries worth about 
$90.
<br>
<br>It was alleged she assaulted a store security guard, Cathryn Groot, 
by pushing her away and forcibly closing the driver's door of her car on
 Ms Groot's arm several times.
<br>
<br>Sgt Beh said no CCTV footage would be tendered as evidence during the trial as it had been destroyed.
<br>
<br>He said a staff member for Fisher attended the Foodland premises 
soon after the alleged incident and viewed the footage with the store 
manager.
<br>When police later asked for the footage their attempts were 
"frustrated" before they were told the vision no longer existed, he 
said.
<br>
<br>"There was a reasonably timely request by police but they were 
unable to secure the CCTV footage which we know existed and we know was 
viewed by one or two members of the Chapley Group (which owns Foodland) 
and one person acting for Ms Fisher," Sgt Beh said.
<br>
<br>Sgt Beh said Ms Groot and the Chapley Group had filed documents with
 police two days after the alleged event stating they did not wish to 
proceed with the charges.
<br>
<br>He said Ms Groot had "always wanted to pursue the charges" but 
reluctantly filled out the document filed with police under instruction.
<br>
<br>Magistrate Kym Boxall ruled the evidence was inadmissable to the trial as it did not relate to the charges.
<br>
<br>Therefore, evidence on those issues will not be heard in court.
<br>
<br>The trial continues.

<br>
<br>AA, Good summary!
<br>In answer to the question you pose, every solution I try to dream up
 has a significant downside. But I find NormanK's answer compelling.
<br>
<br>Given that the boat arrivals are usually about 3k per year (although
 some years have been greater) surely the best solution would be to make
 it easier to get here some other way.
<br>
<br>So if we were to take 30K or 40K&nbsp;&nbsp;per year from other SE Asian countries this might win favour as the preferred way.
<br>
<br>While this sounds like a large number, in the context of an anuual 
immigration intake of 200K-300K per year it is not unreasonable.
<br>
<br>There is another aspect that bothers me. Not withstanding the 
Christmas Island disaster boat crash (which specifically happened 
because they were trying to get onto the treacherous Christmas Island 
shoreline), and a couple of other serious incidents with loss of life, I
 would like to know the accurate figures on loss of life of boat people 
over the past 12 or so years. Perhaps a TPS collleague can provide this.
<br>
<br>Whilst mindful that boat trips in crowded old fishing boats are by 
nature a very high risk, when the safety aspect was first argued by the 
Howard government I had the strong feeling that it was a red herring 
beatup...I felt that Ruddock, Andrews, etc had about the same level of 
genuine concern about boat safety as Abbott expressed in his defence of 
the poor HSU members 2 weeks ago in QT. I haven't changed that view.
<br>
<br>So how about bringing in the 30K-40K by plane, and when 
(fewer)others choose to come by boat, give them a hand at the difficult 
arrival end. With current technology I don't accept that there are any 
surprise arrivals, so they could easily be met and safely chaperoned.</p>

<br>Bidding farewell to our worst foreign minister
<br>
<br>Canberra correspondent Bernard Keane writes:
<br>
<br>In the end, AWB summed up Downer’s foreign ministership perfectly: 
the deliberate turning of a blind eye to the bribery by a National Party
 scam of a tyrant against whom Downer was at that very moment making the
 case for war, about whose toppling Downer would later boast — and 
against whose forces we would shortly send our troops. The wilful 
failure of accountability and the intellectual dishonesty of Downer’s 
response upon discovery — along with that of Howard and Mark 
Vaile — turned even the Howard Government cheerleaders at The Australian
 against him.
<br>
<br><a href="http://www.crikey.com.au/2008/07/02/bidding-farewell-to-our-worst-foreign-minister/" rel="nofollow">www.crikey.com.au/.../</a>
<br>
<br>Honest John just didn't think some ministers deserved a public lashing, no matter how much they stuffed up.
<br>
<br>As for Nosferatu, I mean Philip Ruddock...he held that Immigration 
portfolio for a good long time...regardless of sewn lips &amp; all:
<br>
<br><cite title="Quote">Following the Coalition's rise to government at 
the 1996 election, Ruddock was appointed to the Cabinet as Minister for 
Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. In this role, he presided over 
the Howard government's policies on asylum seekers. Many Australians 
feel that Ruddock's policies became significantly more conservative 
during this period of time, and that earlier political viewpoints had 
been abandoned, in an attempt to maintain favour with Prime Minister 
John Howard. During his time in office, the previous Keating Labor 
Government's practice of mandatory detention of asylum seekers was 
continued and extended. In October 1999, the Australian government 
introduced Temporary Protection Visas for persons who applied for 
refugee status after making an unauthorised arrival in Australia, and 
was the main type of visa issued to refugees when released from 
Australian immigration detention facilities. Many Afghan and Iraqi 
refugees who are no Australian citizens were affected by this policy.
<br>
<br>In 2001 Ruddock was also appointed to the role of Minister for 
Indigenous Affairs. By 2001 he had become a high-profile figure enjoying
 considerable support within the Liberal Party, while being strongly 
opposed by left-wing activists and some human rights advocates. At one 
point he was one of the few senior ministers (besides the prime 
minister) to have needed personal security details.
<br>
<br>Areas in Ruddock's portfolio and some of his decisions were highly 
controversial in Australian politics, and led to Amnesty International's
 public attempt to distance the organisation from him by asking him to 
remove his lapel badge.
<br>
<br>In 2003, Ruddock was accused by the Labor immigration spokesperson, 
Julia Gillard, of personally intervening to give a Filipino with a 
criminal record, Dante Tan, favourable treatment in exchange for 
donations to the Liberal Party. Ruddock acknowledged his role in 
representing a constituent but strongly denied any linkage between his 
actions and any financial support for the Liberal Party.
<br>
<br>In 2003, Ruddock became Attorney-General in a cabinet reshuffle.
<br>(Wikipedia)</cite>
<br>
<br>Honest John survived alot of fibs &amp; screw-ups too.
<br>
<br>Didn't he? 
<br>Even ex-laborite Graham Richardson knows that.
<br>
<br>The Liberal Party &amp; double standards. All part of the game under the rule of the weathervane.

<br>
<br>
<br>In her evidence, Ms Groot said she observed Fisher enter the store 
with a blue canvas personal trolley, collect items from the fruit and 
vegetable department and proceed through several other shelves of the 
store.
<br>
<br>Ms Groot said then Fisher stopped in an aisle and rearranged the 
items in the trolley, keeping some in her hands, seconds before 
proceeding to the checkout.
<br>
<br>"She offered up some long-life milk and other items for payment and paid for them," Ms Groot said.
<br>
<br>However, Ms Groot said Fisher then proceeded to leave the store 
without paying for the fruit and vegetables - including lychees, 
strawberries, blueberries, avocados and mushrooms - that remained in her
 trolley.
<br>
<br>She pursued Ms Fisher out to her car where she had put the trolley on the back seat and got into the driver's seat.
<br>
<br>"I said `I'm a security officer for the supermarket you just left 
and you have some items you have not paid for. Will you please step out 
of the car so we can talk about it?'," Ms Groot said.
<br>
<br>After following Ms Groot back into the security office of the store, with her trolley, Fisher soon became uncooperative.
<br>
<br>When asked to present her identification, Fisher allegedly replied "what if I refuse?" and appeared quite scared, said Ms Groot.
<br>
<br>"She also said, "is there some other way out of this?, to which I said `no'."
<br>
<br>Ms Groot said Fisher then tried to leave the supermarket after going to the bathroom and claiming she "needed fresh air".
<br>
<br>She made it to her vehicle where Ms Groot tried to stop her from 
leaving by standing between Fisher and the car but was pushed out of the
 way.
<br>
<br>There was then a jostle where Fisher slammed the driver-side door on
 Ms Groot's arm several times and pushed her again in the stomach.
<br>
<br>"She was a little rough and she was saying `I can't do this, I can't do this'.
<br>
<br>"I was trying to calm her down. I was telling her the police were on
 their way and telling her to calm down and turn the car off."
<br>
<br>The trial continues

  <p class="content">Federal Opposition MP Sophie Mirabella stirring up the revolting crowd for Tony:
<br>
<br><cite title="Quote">Federal Infrastructure Minister Anthony Albanese
 has been heckled and jostled outside his Sydney electorate office by 
several hundred anti-carbon tax protesters.
<br>
<br>During the rally a female protester grabbed Mr Albanese by the tie and called him "gutless" and a "maggot".
<br>
<br>The rally at Marrickville in Sydney's inner west was organised by 
the Consumers and Taxpayers Association, the group which staged last 
month's Convoy of No Confidence in Canberra.
<br>
<br>Mr Albanese earned the group's ire then by describing the convoy to the national capital as the "convoy of no consequence".
<br>
<br>Today protesters raised several issues at the rally beyond the 
carbon tax, including homosexuality and communism, but saved their 
vitriol for the minister.
<br>
<br>"We don't want Gillard, we don't want the Labor Government, we want an election," one woman shouted to cheers.
<br>
<br>Mr Albanese fought his way through to address the gathering, saying he was used to addressing demonstrations.
<br>
<br>But he told those gathered that they had a funny view of democracy 
in shouting him down and carrying images of Prime Minister Julia Gillard
 next to pictures of a dog.
<br>
<br>"The sort of other signs that we see at this demo; my view is there 
is nothing democratic about that, just as there is nothing democratic 
about about the way that you've acted today," he said.
<br>
<br>He also said he stood by his description of the group's Canberra 
protests, pointing at a sign reading "Convoy of Courage" and saying "it 
doesn't take a great deal of courage for 150 people to abuse one".
<br>
<br>Federal Opposition MP Sophie Mirabella marched with the protesters, telling them to "never be intimidated".</cite>

<br>
<br><cite title="Quote">Sophie Mirabella
<br>
<br>In 2005, she attracted public attention as a key member of an 
informal "ginger group" of Liberal backbenchers. She chaired this group 
with Victorian Senator Mitch Fifield. The group argued for "tax reform" 
(in essence, tax cuts paid for by reductions in government spending), 
sparking public debate on the topic.
<br>
<br>On the prominent issue of asylum seekers, she attacked fellow 
Liberal backbenchers Petro Georgiou and Judi Moylan, labelling them 
"political terrorists" for defying government policy on mandatory 
detention and threatening to hijack the government's agenda by voting 
down the proposals in Parliament. She was rebuffed soon after, as Prime 
Minister John Howard agreed to meet some of their concerns and 
recommendations. In August 2005 she called for Muslim women to be 
required to remove their head dress when posing for photo 
identification.
<br>
<br>Criticism of former Liberal Party leader
<br>
<br>In January 2008, Mirabella launched an attack on former Liberal 
Party Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, after a speech he gave at Melbourne
 University on "the Bush Administration (reversing) 60 years of progress
 in establishing a law-based international system", claiming errors and 
"either intellectual sloppiness or deliberate dishonesty", and that he 
tacitly supports Islamic fundamentalism, should have no influence on 
foreign policy, and that his stance on the war on terror has left him 
open to caricature as a "frothing-at-the-mouth leftie".
<br>
<br> Statements about the Stolen GenerationOn 13 February 2008, 
Mirabella was one of five Liberal Party of Australia MPs not present 
when a motion was passed unanimously apologising to the stolen 
generations of indigenous children between federation and the 1970s. She
 explained her decision by asserting that there had never been a formal 
policy in Victoria of removing children from their families and that 
there is no evidence for any "truly stolen" children,[6] despite the 
fact that the first laws passed giving authorities the right to take 
children from their parents were passed and used in Victoria.
<br>
<br>Gillard-Gaddafi ComparisonOn 2 March 2011, Mirabella compared the 
Prime Minister, Julia Gillard to Moamar Gaddafi, claiming that both were
 delusional. Gillard had recently announced a plan to proceed with a 
carbon tax despite earlier promises to the contrary. The Leader of the 
Opposition, Tony Abbott refused to condemn Mirabella, instead terming 
the comparison colourful and not language he would use.

<br>Rick Perry is yet another action man...gung-ho yeeha from Texas:
<br>
<br><cite title="Quote">Rick Perry and the Neo-cons
<br>
<br>by Philip Giraldi, August 18, 2011 
<br>
<br>
<br>The following, which appeared on the Foreign Policy website, speaks 
for itself regarding where Rick Perry would take us if he is elected. He
 would&nbsp;&nbsp;return to George W. Bush’s foreign policy, complete 
with “you are with us or against us,” “they hate our freedom,” and 
1-percent doctrines, and he would likely staff his administration with 
many of the same people who brought us disaster the first time around: 
<br>
<br>Perry, who has no formal campaign policy team because he has not yet
 announced that he is running, has however held an increasing number of 
meetings with foreign policy experts of all stripes. These meetings, 
which have sometimes gone on for hours, have helped Perry brush up on a 
range of issues, from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to proliferation,
 from Middle East policy to international trade, according to those 
familiar with the meetings. The experts that he has reached out to 
include former Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Doug Feith, former 
NSC strategy guru William Luti, former Assistant U.S. Attorney and 
National Review columnist Andrew McCarthy, former Pentagon official 
Charles “Cully” Stimson, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense 
for Europe Daniel Fata, former Pentagon China official Dan Blumenthal, 
the Heritage Foundation’s Asia expert Peter Brookes, and former U.S. 
Ambassador to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad. Politico reported that 
Donald Rumsfeld helped Perry set up the initial meeting with Feith...
<br>
<br>Doug Feith should be particularly noted, as it appears he might be 
resurfacing in government, a normal recycling that neocons go through as
 they move through the revolving door from high government office to the
 private sector and back again. He is also a poster boy for just how 
corrupt and dishonest the Bush regime was. Perhaps not inappropriately, 
Gen. Tommy Franks once referred to Feith as the “the f***ing stupidest 
guy on the face of the earth,” which apparently was not a disqualifier 
from holding one of the highest offices in the Department of Defense.
<br>
<br>Feith and Luti were associated with the Pentagon’s Office of Special
 Plans, which used fabricated intelligence from Iraqi National Council 
head Ahmed Chalabi to convince the White House to support an invasion of
 Iraq. They might even have been involved in the Niger uranium forgeries
 that convinced the White House that Saddam Hussein was attempting to 
obtain fuel for a nuclear weapon. All of which led to American Secretary
 of State Colin Powell’s eventual humiliation after making a speech at 
the United Nations in which he claimed that Iraq had secret weapons and 
intentions that it clearly did not have. But he and the White House 
still managed to get their war, facts be damned. That war and the 
consequences of the American invasion still continue to bring death and 
destruction eight years later.
<br>
<br>Feith’s activities while holding the number-three position at the 
Pentagon were eventually examined by Defense Department Inspector 
General Thomas Gimble in February 2007. Gimble condemned Feith’s attempt
 to create what he charitably called “an alternative intelligence 
assessment process,” lacking the checks and balances observed by CIA, 
DIA, and INR. But no punishment was recommended for anyone involved in 
the relentless advocacy that enabled the slide to war.
<br>
<br>Per Gimble’s careful parsing, Feith’s activities were deemed 
“inappropriate” but “not illegal or unauthorized.” And his 
investigation’s scope was curiously limited: the yearlong inquiry only 
examined one of the many questionable activities carried out by the 
Office of Special Plans, the purported link between al-Qaeda and Saddam 
Hussein. The role of Feith’s office in hatching the imaginary meeting 
between Mohammad Atta and Iraqi intelligence officials in Prague was 
significant, but it was only a single element in the much broader 
pattern of deception that provided the “evidence” President Bush used to
 convince the American people that Saddam’s Iraq was an existential 
threat akin to Hitler’s Germany. 
<br>
<br>Feith had also long been advising the Israeli government to pressure
 Washington to remove Saddam Hussein. So it was unsurprising when he 
joined Richard Perle, David Wurmser, and others in July 1996 to develop a
 position paper that had Iraqi regime change as its centerpiece. 
Intended for incoming Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the document, 
titled “A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm,” pushed 
the new government to launch preemptive war against Israel’s Arab 
neighbors. “Israel has the opportunity to make a clean break,” the paper
 said, “to engage every possible energy on rebuilding Zionism.” Baghdad 
was first on the hit list — “Whoever inherits Iraq dominates the entire 
Levant strategically,” they wrote — followed by Syria and Lebanon. To 
secure American support for “rolling back” Arab regimes, the group 
advised developing contrived motives for the invasions — in Syria’s 
case, counterfeiting, drug running, and WMD development. 
<br>
<br>During the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq, Israeli military 
officers and diplomats had free access to Feith’s offices and those of 
his boss, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz. Both had been 
investigated earlier in their careers on suspicion of passing secrets to
 Israel — Feith in 1982, Wolfowitz in 1978. Analysts working for Feith 
who were not uncritically supportive of the U.S.-Israel relationship 
were weeded out. Feith’s sympathies were scarcely secret. In 2003, 
National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice commented after a Feith 
presentation, “Thanks, Doug, but when we want the Israeli position we’ll
 invite the ambassador,” while Secretary of State Colin Powell’s Chief 
of Staff Lawrence Wilkerson described Feith “as a card-carrying member 
of Likud.” 
<br>
<br>Then there is the issue — which has never been completely 
investigated despite a request from former CIA director George Tenet — 
of how Feith’s presentation of the case for an Iraq-al-Qaeda connection,
 based on over 50 documents, most of which were classified, was 
fortuitously leaked to Stephen Hayes at the always receptive Weekly 
Standard. At that time, several of The Weekly Standard’s regular 
contributors actually worked in Feith’s Office of Special Plans, a 
possible conflict of interest that has never been explained or 
examined...
<br>
<br>So, Doug, that is quite a record, something to be proud of, and 
welcome back to the playing field. Another governor of Texas who knows 
nothing about foreign policy should be the perfect tabula rasa for you 
and your neoconservative friends to write upon. A badly battered United 
States has somehow survived eight years since you initiated your last 
adventure in Iraq, but it is unlikely to survive eight more if Rick 
Perry takes your advice and resumes the project of remaking the Middle 
East. “Hawk internationalist,” indeed.</cite>

<br>Thank you for your considered response.&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of 
increasing the intake of asylum seekers substantially has 
merit.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we targeted the groups planning or likely to plan 
to come by boat, the number coming that way should 
diminish.&nbsp;&nbsp;But as I understand it, they would not be easy to 
locate as they sail from a myriad of small jetties in a tangle of jungle
 flora on thousands of Indonesian islands.&nbsp;&nbsp;This why the 
Indonesian authorities have such trouble stopping them, or so they say.
<br>
<br>Also it would mean that that group, which appears to have financial 
resources that the majority of asylum seekers lack, will be favoured, 
and once again it will be the wealthy who benefit while the less well 
off languish.
<br>
<br>As for chaperoning them once detected on the high seas, while that 
would reduce risk, I suspect it would encourage more boat arrivals, and 
since there seems to be an almost endless supply of people wishing to 
come here, the numbers could become overwhelming.
<br>
<br>It really is an almost intractable problem.
<br>
<br>Folks 
<br>I have an anniversary to celebrate so I’ll be out for the evening.

 the education &amp; healthcare for youth be far superior to that

  <p class="content">Thanks AA, you've expressed my thoughts 
exactly.&nbsp;&nbsp; One wishes too one could ask those questions of the
 judges who made that ruling.&nbsp;&nbsp; My immediate reaction when I 
heard their ruling was much the same as FS, <em>Bugger! </em>&nbsp;&nbsp;Trying
 to make sense of it later the thoughts that came to mind were phrases 
like 'the law is an ass' and 'justice is blind' even though I know the 
meaning,&nbsp;&nbsp;origin and usual context of those 
phrases.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was also thinking to myself that however much 
knowledge of the law these men have they lack common sense if the well 
being of refugees in general and not just the two cases before them was 
their concern.
<br>
<br>Their ruling seemed to disregard the current political context of 
this being a worthy attempt by a government to find as humane a solution
 as possible to a long term impasse which has caused death to many 
hundreds and years of suffering to thousands more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their 
decision, as 'just' an interpretation of the law they could come to, is 
likely to contribute directly to the election of an immoral 
and&nbsp;&nbsp;unscrupulous government which will find a loophole to 
circumvent any principles of fairness and justice this ruling seeks to 
uphold.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<br>You might be interested in the last three paragraphs in Bernard Keane’s piece in <em>Crikey</em> today”
<br>
<br><em>” It's an unusual decision that unites Left and Right. Asylum 
seeker advocates, the Greens and progressives are delighted with the 
High Court judgment because it cruels the Malaysian deal and rules out 
unaccompanied minors ever being sent offshore. Conservatives are 
cracking the bubbly because it's a major blow to an ailing government. 
Even a lot of Labor MPs were hoping the court would vote it down. And 
asylum seekers and people smugglers will be delighted as well. Already 
there are plenty of reports of boat trips, delayed pending a resolution 
of the Malaysian issue, about to start from Indonesia.
<br>
<br>"That means hundreds of asylum seekers will now risk their lives to 
try to get here when they otherwise may not have. If one of those boats 
founders, lives will be lost. When the Left and the Right have stopped 
fetishising this issue as either a one-stop test of national morality or
 some macho game of border security, we're left with the policy problems
 of how many asylum seekers Australia should take, and how we can stop 
lives being placed at risk.
<br>
<br>"The point of the Malaysian deal -- a deal seemingly more criticised
 than properly understood -- was to try to address both at the same 
time. When all the cheering has stopped, we still need to address those 
issues. And doing nothing, warehousing people on Nauru before inevitably
 allowing them to come to Australia or only giving them Temporary 
Protection Visas, aren't any more solutions than what's left of the 
Malaysian deal now that the High Court has ripped it apart.”</em>
<br>
<br>I’m now off for the evening.
